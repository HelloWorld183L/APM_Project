<br /> No, he's getting **** for the rest of the life because he's always been a polarizing poster who either you agree with or you hate, because he's a dismissive dick and thinks he's always right about everything.

<br /> So yeah, if the way you want to play this game is within his personal agenda, I guess he's cool, otherwise he wants everything you play to suck so that he wins every game from then on AND HE WANTS IT RIGHT NOW AND YOU BETTER NOT SAY OTHERWISE.

          you people all make me sick. He did nothing wrong to deserve it. 
          Everyone just targets him because they don't like him even if he 
          doesn't do anything wrong now. Why don't you sad nerds go find 
          something to do with your lives other than talk **** about someone 
          that doesn't even affect your guys' lives? Oh wait you don't have

          couple of times, that's about it, and i'd defend anyone in his 
          position if the same thing were to happen because this thread and 
          you people are full of ****. You all disgust me.<br><br>Gd is like

    care?<br><br>You going to take this mirror crusade up all night?<br><br>Is 
    this mirror strategy the best thing you got going for you right now?<br><br>It's 
    a really simple question actually. Especially since, more than likely, the 
    contents of this thread are pretty much meaningless.

    wow took you long enough to do some research. which i'm not going to 
    bother acknowledging because you said &quot;tiamat was not in season 1&quot;<br><br>which 
    is straight up wrong. you said nothing about the bug not being in season 1 
    therefore you're wrong. learn to formulate a correct argument. also, i 
    said it in my first post and across multiple of my posts that i don't give 
    a **** if it's fd897c3091b5bee1 or someone else. you're probably the most 
    retarded fa <b>gg</b>ot in this thread.<br><br>also, stay down? you have 
    to get me down before i can stay that way first. i repeat, <b>you're 
    probably the most retarded shitposting faggot in this thread.</b>

          you people all make me sick. he did nothing wrong to deserve it. 
          everyone just targets him because they don't like him even if he 
          doesn't do anything wrong now. why don't you sad nerds go find 
          something to do with your lives other than talk **** about someone 
          that doesn't even affect your guys' lives? oh wait you don't have 
          lives... that's why you're making this thread.<br><br>inb4 &quot;hurr 
          durr fd897c3091b5bee1 fanboy&quot; no not really. i've seen his stream a 
          couple of times, that's about it, and i'd defend anyone in his 
          position if the same thing were to happen because this thread and 
          you people are full of ****. you all disgust me.<br><br>GD is like 
          highschool, everyone says everyone in GD is cancerous filth well 
          guess what the same applies to you kids.

    What the **** did you just ****ing say about me, you little *****? I&#194;&#146;ll 
    have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I&#194;&#146;ve 
    been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 
    confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I&#194;&#146;m the top sniper 
    in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another 
    target. I will wipe you the **** out with precision the likes of which has 
    never been seen before on this Earth, mark my ****ing words. You think you 
    can get away with saying that **** to me over the Internet? Think again, 
    ****er. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the 
    USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the 
    storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call 
    your life. You&#194;&#146;re ****ing dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I 
    can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that&#194;&#146;s just with my bare 
    hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have 
    access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will 
    use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the 
    continent, you little ****. If only you could have known what unholy 
    retribution your little &#194;&#147;clever&#194;&#148; comment was about to bring down upon 
    you, maybe you would have held your ****ing tongue. But you couldn&#194;&#146;t, you 
    didn&#194;&#146;t, and now you&#194;&#146;re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will **** 
    fury all over you and you will drown in it. You&#194;&#146;re ****ing salty, kiddo.
