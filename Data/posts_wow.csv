<br />They seemed to remove more than they added in WoD. The little content that IS there is not all that fun at that. 
<br />I like the dungeons and the few bosses I have done in the raid are pretty nice... But the world is just empty and boring, filled with reused models and annoying timesinks. It's a pain in the *** to go anywhere in the world but there is just no reason to so why bother?","2014-12-07 07:22:00"

149,4,"17c6d6136ab3d95c","The problem is, vanilla didn't have any lfr, lfd, quest objectives tracker on map, so many teleports, PvP queue, etc. Returning vanilla play in WoD is like returning medieval social order in modern world. It just doesn't belong there any more. It was fun, big fun. But it's over now. Look at reputation grind in WoD. Most people hated it in vanilla. Most people hate it now.","2014-12-07 07:36:00"
149,6,"3cf8346331af1dd4","+1 to 2d165465644b525e regarding the fact they seemed to have added less than they taken in WOD but as i also mnetioned WOD is unfinished.","2014-12-07 07:39:00"
149,5,"3cf8346331af1dd4","Did they even beta test WOD for fun it seems not and also WOD was released unfinished, Tanaan Jungle anyone? 
<br /> 
<br />The ability pruning killed a lot of specs, I feel pigeon holed into playing destruction because it's the most viable in terms of DPS but to be honest all warlock specs are abysmal right now so it doesn't matter if I'm melee'ing bosses, crap DPS is crap DPS. 
<br />Specs has in a way gone back to Vanilla where there is truely ONLY one spec that works and everything else is broken or not fun like Arms warrior 3 button rotation anyone? Rend, MS, whrilwind and whirlwind and whirldwind some more and then OMG MS is back then whirlwind, I'm getting dizzy from just thinking about it. 
<br />The ability pruning hit some classes harder than others and has made some classes completely broken in all 3 specs and it's not fun to completely play the underdog no matter which specialization you choose. 
<br /> 
<br />They completely obliterated all professions and everything is gated behind cooldowns, it's all a ploy to make you sub for longer to do less content because as stated before WOD is an unfinished product. 
<br />Imagine if we had to go out and mine 50 ores to combine to make 1 truesteel ingot, that's 5000 ores to make one craftable but I bet you any money people will still find a way to do that in 2-3 days instead of waiting and waiting and even more waiting for their work orders to complete. 
<br /> 
<br />People who choose to go HAM with thier professions will benefit most like it's always been, you'd go out and farm your mats, long it was, tedious it might have been but rewarding it certainly is. 
<br />Now with a few clicks here and there you now have your very own welfare epic. 
<br /> 
<br />Garrisonville, just makes the game feel so empty and it doesn't immerse you in the world of warcraft it's more like World of Garrisons and with Mafia Wars thrown into it. You log on, do your mining, herbing, work orders and then send your slaves off on missions. This takes 15 minutes tops. 
<br />Then maybe depending on long the missions were you'd log on once every 1 hour, 4 hour and then 8 hour to send your slaves off on missions again. 
<br />If you have a Salvage yard, you'd Salvage for loot and loot all your work orders that are ready. 
<br />Rinse and repeat everyday since level 100 and that was almost 1 month ago. 
<br /> 
<br />Okay, maybe just maybe you'd do a heroic for your inn dailies but honestly who'd want to do those anymore after you've done them to death and are already 635+? 
<br />Play with your friend's you might say? Not even they log on anymore because Garrisonville isn't not entertaining, que song &quot;all by myself&quot; 
<br /> 
<br />Highmaul has just been released and that'll keep the masses at bay for a while but remember after Blackrock foundry nothing 
<span class=""underline""><strong>new</strong></span> is coming out until March and that is being very optimistic! 
<br /> 
<br />TL:DR 
<br /> 
<br />Ability pruning ruined classes. 
<br />WOD released as unfinished product. 
<br />Garrisons make the WoW more un social 
<br />Professions completely Obliterated. 
<br />No incentive to run heroics beyond 635 ilvl.","2014-12-07 07:36:00"

    Being hard and challenging is ok. Being tedious and grindy is not ok. In 
    vanilla, reputations were a nightmare to get to exalted. Look at 
    Shen'dralar reputation. Look at Hydraxian Waterlords reputation. Look at 
    the famous Brood of Nozdormu reputation grind before actual AQ opening. 
    Killing thousands and thousands of same mobs just to get to exalted is not 
    fun to most people. Why? Because it feels like a chore. It's the same 
    routine without any options. Is it hard? No. Is it grindy? Yes.

Otherwise it will feel like work, or worse a prison. There needs to be a citidal and grand final resting place to take on the big bad villian. And there needed to be a place that was epic where we could meet and show off our spoils.

<br />My happiest days were spent battling all day and then returning to Stormwind to train. I may then craft an outfit having spent all week fighting mobs for cloth. And then I would strut about in Stormwind and felt proud. Even at the lower levels when we were attacked by the Horde we would all do our bit. It felt like I was on this epic journey. Once I got off the boat at Theramore and I saw these two Night Elf characters on white cats and my jaw dropped. That was what the game was about. 
<br /> 
<br />Sadly these guys lost the true development team at Cata. Not sure what the fall out was. I am thinking they decided to focus on other things. It is so sad, so so sad. The game that I loved and treasured had all the real questing content stripped out at Cata... and what was replaced was junk. And the stuiff since has been just gimmicks, phasing, cross realm etc. Illusions of content rather than real content. It is real content that keeps players in game. 
<br /> 
<br />So maybe the journey, that epic journey.... dare I say that Lord of the Rings journey is missing. The fellowship of friends, the impossible challenges and the sense of achievement.

  </div>Sometimes I just ask myself...What if Blizzard simply added the garrison in a patch and skipped all the WoD stuff as a whole expansion, it would surely get as interesting as it is now. An expansion gone waste is all I can say to describe WoD. 
  <br /> 
  <br />I mean sure I was doing dailies and stuff in BC, WOTLK, CATA, MOP...But in none of them I lied there on ground dying out of boredom in my garrison waiting for queues. In other expansion there were people around me I could toy with. Waiting all alone is something I cant stand for.

 </div>The game misses the feeling of journey. From my early days of playing, like any game, you have to feel you are going somewhere. Otherwise it will feel like work, or worse a prison. There needs to be a citidal and grand final resting place to take on the big bad villian. And there needed to be a place that was epic where we could meet and show off our spoils. 
 <br /> 
 <br />My happiest days were spent battling all day and then returning to Stormwind to train. I may then craft an outfit having spent all week fighting mobs for cloth. And then I would strut about in Stormwind and felt proud. Even at the lower levels when we were attacked by the Horde we would all do our bit. It felt like I was on this epic journey. Once I got off the boat at Theramore and I saw these two Night Elf characters on white cats and my jaw dropped. That was what the game was about.

<br /> 
<br />Agreed 100%, always been someone who just gets on with what we are given, but WoW these days is just a shell of what it once was. 
<br /> 
<br />When I started way back, I looked upon this character as someone who I had grown with, taking them from being a young and inexperienced orc to where he is now, I looked upon him as an extension of me in a fantasy world, a world where I could escape to after a long day in work. 
<br /> 
<br />These day's there is no journey of exploration, no journey of bettering the character, it's just as if he is part of a team with my other character's. 
<br /> 
<br />Part of this problem in my opinion is that there is far too much BoA stuff now, each character doesn't feel independent. WoW has changed so much since I started in 2006, back then it was an adventure, now it feels like a watered down game to play for a few hours here and there. 
<br /> 
<br />I am trying to think back to when MoP was released, I can't believe that I am now sitting at max level on 3 characters with WoD only 3 weeks into the release. Even with MoP there seemed more to do, more to explore, more to actually get on with. This just seems very.....empty?","2014-12-07 09:54:00"

<br /> 
<br />Cities are barren, nearly every class has useless specs. 
<br />WoD started out great, but ended up being a massive disappointment.

Whats so bad about Warrior giving us a buff that no one else can so we can praise him for his job, acknowledge his usefulness and require his services further? What so bad about having a bunch of useful gadgets that can literally save the group and create miracles?

149,46,"065f94a64bb11fb5","While I do enjoy WoD, the more I play it the more it's obvious that it suffers from some serious glaring flaws and design decisions. 
<br /> 
<br />1: The removal of Justice/Valor makes dungeons pointless. It doesn't take long to get the gear you need and once you've done that, there is absolutely no reason at all to do the dungeons. 05e461fbdb77addfviously, I tended to at least do one LFD for the Valor. Without that (Resources ain't worth the time, I get enough of that), there's no reason. 
<br /> 
<br />As a followup on that, there's also pretty much nothing to buy to help you progress apart from Apexis Gear, which feels really underpowered compared to the time it takes to obtain it. 
<br /> 
<br />2: No scenarios. No easy, fast fix for some currency and a easier shot at gear. 
<br /> 
<br />3: Treasure hunts and rares are one-time only. If these things continued to drop things afterwards they would make it much more attractive to go out in the world. But no, they're just good as you level up and immediately as you hit 100. Once that's done and the treasures are found and mobs are killed, there's no point doing that either. 
<br /> 
<br />4: A surprisingly limiting time-based gameplay. Is this a paid MMO, or a F2P game? Seems like everything has a cooldown. You want to craft something? Wait. We don't care that you actually have the mats or you got lots of time today to get more done. Go do something else as you can't work on your professions anyway. You want more Apexis shards? Wait until tomorrow. 
<br /> 
<br />5: The complete removal of dailies means that you can't pick and choose in bit-size amounts how, where and what you want to do. After MoP, this feels like an awful step back. I recall Blizzard talking about how this would be modelled after timeless isle, which gave me a bad feeling back then. Even then, WoD once you hit 100, makes Timeless Isle feel like a masterpiece. WoD at 100 is an empty shell, with no further reason to go out in the world. Log in, do your garrison stuff and log out. They really need to offer alternatives, not just strip the game. But Blizzard has a bad habit of deciding FOR the players instead of letting us choose what and how to enjoy the game.","2014-12-07 11:12:00"

  </div>I am playing this game for a while now but I have never witnessed SO MANY of my friends in battlenet being offline for DAYS and almost always disconnecting in mere hours. 
  <br /> 
  <br />Personal experience, me and my girlfriend were hardcore WoW players. I can be a cynical bastard at times, I had the thought of getting imprisoned in garrison with no one around to see, doing dailies and spamming a bunch of boring heroics 24/7 were kinda killing my fun for a while... But today when my Blizzard obsessed girlfriend whose barely logged off this game since WOTLK woke up and told me &quot;I am not feeling to play WoW at all today...&quot; and played something else instead...it really made me think that the expansion already ran out of fun. Another hardcore PvP freak friend who wasted nights over this game bought WoD and I couldnt see him online again after that login attempt. And the list goes on with so many &quot;Last login more than a week&quot; guys all over...Out of all my huge friend list I have 3-4 constantly online brave souls SITTING IN THEIR GARRISONS AFK 24/7. No one is there farming transmogs anymore...Hell being in an RP server, even Stormwind Church has less people than ever. 
  <br /> 
  <br />I have seen others complaning about situation on Trade Chat lately, your average gaming trash's reply to them was &quot;Go play something else&quot;. What can I do?! I love WoW. Its the only MMO I can play with huge player database. But I just cant FORCE myself to do inn dailies anymore. I COULDNT EVEN FINISH MY DAILY HERB AND MINING TOURS TODAY! 
  <br /> 
  <br />By god, what has happened to this game? I have never seen WoW so isolated, boring and out of content before... 
 </blockquote> 
 <br /> 
 <br />They seemed to remove more than they added in WoD. The little content that IS there is not all that fun at that. 
 <br />I like the dungeons and the few bosses I have done in the raid are pretty nice... But the world is just empty and boring, filled with reused models and annoying timesinks. It's a pain in the *** to go anywhere in the world but there is just no reason to so why bother?

<br /> 
<br />I want my abilities sewn back on to my characters, so that my fingers aren't lunging for spells that aren't there any more. 
<br /> 
<br />I want my characters to be fun to play again. I mean, just fun to play, on a second to second basis. 
<br /> 
<br />I want Professions removed from Garrisons. Ripped right out. They have no business being there, and were put in only to force the garrisons on us. Ideally, I'd like the Iron Horde to invade, raze the profession buildings, bomb the mine, sew salt in the Herb Garden and blow a hole in the side of the fishing pond that would make it drain out over the side towards the sea. And I want them to offer me the detonators to do all that. 
<br /> 
<br />I want Profession skill to mean something beyond yield again. 
<br /> 
<br />I want to have something to do with Professions again. 
<br /> 
<br />I want every Profession to have specialisations that you can choose at 700, like the Alchemy Masteries or the Panda Cooking, with serious rewards for achieving them, and I want to to be a damn long slog to achieve them. 
<br /> 
<br />I want dailies. Lots of dailies. Dailies with factions that had interesting stories. Dailies that I could choose which set of 6, or 10, I wanted to do at the moment. Proper dailies, not these afterthought one-choice-a-day things. 
<br /> 
<br />I want repeatable rewards from kills and treasures in the world. Blizzard said they were going to take elements of the Timeless experience into Draenor world. They didn't.

    Previously there were things to do outside of raids. I've very much 
    enjoyed this game for the last nine and a half years with only rarely 
    raiding, and since LFR existed, that's all the raiding I've done. Because 
    there was other content which suited me better. This expansion, there's a 
    whole lot less to do.<br><br>I miss dailies: I REALLY miss having an 
    ongoing storyline which dailies fed into. The 5.1 content was fantastic, 
    do a few dailies (out of a large pool) then get a new piece of story, it 
    held the interest for several weeks. I'd really hoped we'd have at least 
    one ongoing story like that, but it seems Blizz didn't want to repeat one 
    of the best things they did in MoP (yes, too many dailies was unpopular, 
    but that particular set worked great, I thought).<br><br>I miss scenarios: 
    as a thin-skinned healer, I don't like doing dungeons too often, but 
    scenarios were a nice no-pressure way of getting some gear, currency, or 
    just having a bit of fun. I don't get why they were pushed so hard in MoP 
    (at the expense of 5-mans), and now removed entirely. One extreme or the 
    other.<br><br>I miss professions: the current log on once a day, loot your 
    work orders, craft your cd, and log off system is zero fun. Sure, it used 
    to be grindy farming mats, but if you wanted to put the work in, you could 
    make progress. the gating is so painful, and removes any fun out of it.<br><br>This 
    world is beautiful, and the storyline in the levelling content really 
    caught my interest, I'd say it was my favourite ever levelling experience. 
    I want to go out there, see more of it, learn more about the people and 
    places, interact with the various factions etc etc. Instead my options are 
    mindless grinding for no story-based reason (I haven't even been directed 
    anywhere by representatives of the few factions who exist), dungeons 
    (again for no particular reason, Skyreach is the only one introduced while 
    questing), or just sit in my garrison waiting for missions to end. I am so 
    disappointed.

  <br />Many players that played WoW for years are disappointed and they have good reasons to be.

 <br />I want my abilities sewn back on to my characters, so that my fingers aren't lunging for spells that aren't there any more. 
 <br /> 
 <br />I want my characters to be fun to play again. I mean, just fun to play, on a second to second basis. 
 <br /> 
 <br />I want Professions removed from Garrisons. Ripped right out. They have no business being there, and were put in only to force the garrisons on us. Ideally, I'd like the Iron Horde to invade, raze the profession buildings, bomb the mine, sew salt in the Herb Garden and blow a hole in the side of the fishing pond that would make it drain out over the side towards the sea. And I want them to offer me the detonators to do all that. 
 <br /> 
 <br />I want Profession skill to mean something beyond yield again. 
 <br /> 
 <br />I want to have something to do with Professions again. 
 <br /> 
 <br />I want every Profession to have specialisations that you can choose at 700, like the Alchemy Masteries or the Panda Cooking, with serious rewards for achieving them, and I want to to be a damn long slog to achieve them. 
 <br /> 
 <br />I want dailies. Lots of dailies. Dailies with factions that had interesting stories. Dailies that I could choose which set of 6, or 10, I wanted to do at the moment. Proper dailies, not these afterthought one-choice-a-day things. 
 <br /> 
 <br />I want repeatable rewards from kills and treasures in the world. Blizzard said they were going to take elements of the Timeless experience into Draenor world. They didn't. 
 <br /> 
 <br />I want currencies back that can be achieved in many ways, with meaningful progression using them.

<br /> 
<br />1- Add some dailies (like the ones in patch 5.1) 
<br />

<br />It's not the quantity of content, it's the replayability of it. Just as the most basic and obvious example; rare mobs in MoP did not always drop their cool shinies the first time you killed them, and they had a chance to drop some (sometimes incredibly lucrative) bags full of additional loot as well. 
<br />Now in WoD, you kill them once and you're done forever. There are only a few exceptions to this rule, and even the few mobs worth killing more than once offer meagre rewards compared to those in the previous expansion. 
<br /> 
<br />It's the exact same content, only in one expansion it was designed to remain rewarding for weeks, months, and even years on end, while in WoD it can be exhausted within a matter of days. This extends to many areas of the current expansion, where content quickly becomes irrelevant, or is naturally tedious and unengaging in the first place. A few relatively minor changes could make a big difference to this, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed for the content patches.","2014-12-07 20:25:00"

<br />Yeah that's gonna suck very bad.. But that gearing thing I can live with. Doing the conquest cap on a few characters isn't the worst thing... 
<br />However, if there's something that removes alts, it's the Garrison. Who has the motivation to do all of those chores on 3-4 different characters? I sure don't.","2014-12-07 21:23:00"

<br />In pretty much every previous expansion I had no issue with mindlessly grinding dungeons all day, now after 1 or 2 I'm bored out of my mind. Running around hunting rares seemed like it could be interesting at first, but very quickly became tedious and from what I can tell max level consists, basically of doing exactly the same thing, but more.

WOD as of right now dosent have fly mounts ability, but there is no reason for people to leave the citys/ garrisons. and i cant vanish from guards, so ganking in the citys and having fun there is out the question. LFR/G makes people teleport around instead of actually going to the instance. I found Black rock mountain quite enjoyable in vanilla, just waiting for the next dude on his way to the instance that i could kill. Or howabout Hillsbrad foothills?, the wars there?. I thought WOD was gonna bring me some of that feeling back, but mounting up and running around in nagrand is pointless, because most ppl are in the garrisons signing in for BGs or LFR. Trashcan as some other here calls it, well.....Might aswell sign for a BG, then i dont need to bother with stupid artifacts and MORE bones to my garisson. This game is just flat and booring i feel, but maybe its just me getting to old or that im the type of guy who thinks everything was better before.

<br /> 
<br />They not only removed abilities from classes, they also removed passives that made the class have depth. Im cool with removing abilities, but why the passives? It just makes the class i play so boring. 
<br /> 
<br />Garrisons sucks, id prefer real towns. 
<br /> 
<br />Follower quests sucks and dont belong to an MMO. 
<br /> 
<br />Ashran city is a big epic fail. 
<br /> 
<br />The dailies bores me to death. The best daily is ironically the fishing daily. Congratulations. 
<br /> 
<br />Everytime i open the map i expect the screen to flash and a message saying &quot;OH MY GOD NEW EVENT HERE NEW EVENT COME TO THIS PLACE YOU GOT TO KILL THIS BOSS HERE AND SAVE THE PLACE!&quot; like the bonus objective kind of stuffs. I mean whats the point in having no flying when theres nothing to do? 
<br /> 
<br />The rewards could have been mining ores and weed instead of putting them in the freaking garrison. 
<br /> 
<br />And the epics.. EPICS are even easier to get. Rofl getting rewarded an EPIC from a quest to be replaced 10 minutes later. Are you joking? Couldnt you have put a &quot;Upgrade level 1/2/3&quot; as rare bonuses instead of putting EPIC on it?! 
<br /> 
<br />And the first real epic you get is a ring from a NORMAL DUNGEON quest? 
<br /> 
<br />What is the worst thing about this expansion? Its the classes. Yeah they removed the depth of many specs. I cant imagine playing longer than one month. I mean imagine getting another 20 months of waiting for the new expansion with this boring 1,2,3 nothing else kind of class. 
<br /> 
<br />I hate to say this but i prefer MOP over WOD. 
<br /> 
<br />I knew WOD would disappoint me the moment i entered the portal and streamrolled every mob with closed eyes. Whats so GOOD about it? What made people go &quot;the best expansion ever&quot; when the first reward is a high ilvl blue weapon.. a blue.. weapon. A rare weapon. First reward is a rare. 
<br /> 
<br />I dont remember anything. Everything just went so fast. Its like doing daily quest crap in MOP using SOO gear. No challenge, nothing to remember, just press 1 and 2 while almost falling asleep. 
<br /> 
<br />The only thing i remember gotta be the orc male that dug some !@#$ and threw it into the water. 
<br /> 
<br />Yeah this whole expansion is filled with %^-*. If you look closely you can find !@#$ everywhere. Even at the pale orc areas. Oh man pale orcs taking a %^-*? And whats up with !@#$ turd diahrea piles near sacrificed bodies in unholy places? Yeah the expansion got so boring i looked after piles of %^-*.

<br />Yeah, what is up with the work orders? 
<br /> 
<br />You seem to put in tons of resources and get virtually nothing back. 
<br /> 
<br />I actually like the concept of Garrisons. 
<br /> 
<br />My problem with them is that they were too central to levelling and meant that you needed to do so many quests to get followers and now they appear to be too central to gearing. 
<br /> 
<br />Then you have the rep grinds - I've been coping with that, but it's going to get old very fast. 
<br /> 
<br />Some people didn't like all the dailies in MoP, so they answered that with Timeless Isle. 
<br /> 
<br />So, that is apparently all they have got - endless dailies, or rare killing and rep grinds. 
<br /> 
<br />Even if that is all they have got, it would be nice to have options; but not if they aren't really options, but compulsory. 
<br /> 
<br />So, they could give you the option of doing a set of dailies, or grinding rep and you could choose which one for that specific day. 
<br /> 
<br />Actually, more rewards associated with instances (dungeons, LFR etc.) would suit someone like me better, personally, as that is what I prefer doing with my time. 
<br /> 
<br />So, maybe there should be four options in the Town Hall every day? 
<br /> 
<br />Pick one: dailies, rep grind, dungeon rewards, or raid (including LFR, when it opens) rewards?","2014-12-07 22:22:00"

<br />I'm looking for something to do, Farming herbs or ore is pointless as you simply get almost nothing from the nodes that make it worthwhile, And even if you do the cooldown on materials required to craft anything also makes farming the most pointless venture in the game.

<br />and pvp is an utter mess if ashran is anything like that anniversary event with massive zerg groups I will seriously have a headache as a melee.

 </div>I am playing this game for a while now but I have never witnessed SO MANY of my friends in battlenet being offline for DAYS and almost always disconnecting in mere hours. 
 <br /> 
 <br />Personal experience, me and my girlfriend were hardcore WoW players. I can be a cynical bastard at times, I had the thought of getting imprisoned in garrison with no one around to see, doing dailies and spamming a bunch of boring heroics 24/7 were kinda killing my fun for a while... But today when my Blizzard obsessed girlfriend whose barely logged off this game since WOTLK woke up and told me &quot;I am not feeling to play WoW at all today...&quot; and played something else instead...it really made me think that the expansion already ran out of fun. Another hardcore PvP freak friend who wasted nights over this game bought WoD and I couldnt see him online again after that login attempt. And the list goes on with so many &quot;Last login more than a week&quot; guys all over...Out of all my huge friend list I have 3-4 constantly online brave souls SITTING IN THEIR GARRISONS AFK 24/7. No one is there farming transmogs anymore...Hell being in an RP server, even Stormwind Church has less people than ever. 
 <br /> 
 <br />I have seen others complaning about situation on Trade Chat lately, your average gaming trash's reply to them was &quot;Go play something else&quot;. What can I do?! I love WoW. Its the only MMO I can play with huge player database. But I just cant FORCE myself to do inn dailies anymore. I COULDNT EVEN FINISH MY DAILY HERB AND MINING TOURS TODAY! 
 <br /> 
 <br />By god, what has happened to this game? I have never seen WoW so isolated, boring and out of content before...

<br /> 
<br />I salute you.","2014-12-08 03:07:00"
149,114,"45e750fcfb89e634","Well, here's my opinion - in case anybody cares. Hear me out until the end, if you will. 
<br /> 
<br />I feel like most of the upvotes here are just preaching to their own choir. 
<br /> 
<br />I've been playing this game for way more hours than I should have for the past month or so. Been constantly doing something, and didn't have a chance to get bored yet. Maybe I will soon, who knows? But for now, doing daily garrison quests, the apexis crystal invasion quest, fishing, hunting for cooking mats, placing work orders, sending followers on missions, levelling a new profession (in my case)... I barely know how to manage my time in this game. I haven't even had the time to finish the Nagrand questline yet! And we now have a new, and somewhat challenging, raid introduced to us. How do you people do it? How do you have time for all that and still get bored? 
<br /> 
<br />Yeah I bet queues suck if you're a DPS. But, to be frank, what did you expect? How about taking some initiative and starting a group if you can't wait 40 minutes? 
<br /> 
<br />Yeah the garrison isolates you from big cities. But that's a matter of taste. I prefer having my own citadel and only going to the city for AH - others don't. And the most important aspect of this is: you don't HAVE to stay in your garrison. You can go to the major cities, it's your choice. Nothing's stopping you! You can submit your work orders in 2 minutes and go in whatever city you wish after. The fact that most people choose not to is a sign they PREFER to stay in their garrison. 
<br /> 
<br />Now about PvP. I'll admit, I'm not much of a PvPer. I haven't played this game since WotLK, and I remember I quite enjoyed Wintergrasp there - it was simple, to the point and tied in with the plot nicely, providing clear benefits. I've been to Ashran once, and I'll probably never go again unless I have to. It's a mess, I didn't understand what I had to do, where to go, and what the objectives were. Heck, I don't even understand why the Horde and Alliance are there. And the queue times. Oh lordy loo. 
<br /> 
<br />The biggest problem, which I agree with, is that outside of doing the bonus objectives, gathering timber and the weekly world boss, there really isn't much reason to be out there in Draenor at all. Training some mounts for stables, maybe... and gathering boar meat. What happened to the PvP events like in Hellfire Peninsula back in TBC? Those were quite entertaining, not sure why they wouldn't do something like that again. 
<br /> 
<br />Overall, for me, someone coming back to the game after a long pause, the game seems alright. It has some severe hicups (I still for the life of me can't think of a good explanation for the absurd loot tables in raids for tanks), but it has its ups as well. To me, it seems like the garrison is trying to force players into engaging in every aspect of the game - be it fishing, cooking, farming primals or the follower mini-games. Which some people understandably detest as they want to specialize and choose how they spend their time instead of waiting for work orders while doing other stuff they deem is a waste of their time. For me, as someone who is *trying* to take things into moderation, it's been a pleasant experience so far. I'm sure it will become dreadful as content gets stale, but that's not a bad time to take a break and wait for the next patch . 
<br /> 
<br />Well, that's my two cents. If I can be permitted to offer some advice - try to take the game into moderation if you feel bored already. I know it sounds cheesy, but it really couldn't hurt.","2014-12-08 03:35:00"

    What bothers me the most is that for both TBC and WotLK Blizzard kept on 
    telling us they would not add Auction Houses to either Shattrath or 
    Dalaran, the reason being that if we had them it would eliminate the only 
    reason for players to interact with others in older cities.<br><br>That 
    was the main reason. That was posted by a blue (661887c6a03ecdb0).<br><br>In 
    Cata they removed portals from Shatt and Dalaran for a somewhat similar 
    reason &#8211; because if we had them there we could heart into older-content 
    cities and not interact with people in old Azeroth.<br><br>That was pretty 
    annoying, but we went along with it 'cause it kinda made sense.<br><br>Some 
    folks were asking for ages to have major stuff added to cities other than 
    Orgrimmar and Stormwind: Transmog, Voids, etc. Again the reason not to put 
    them there was that the community would be too spread across cities and it 
    wouldn't feel like a breathing, living world.<br><br>Well, guess what, 
    Garrisons have made ALL cities deserted. Seriously. For years you guys 
    didn't want to add auctioneers, trainers, banks, so we could be in the 
    same place together and now all of a sudden we get to have out own little 
    empty dorp in the middle of nowhere.<br><br>And what is the brilliant 
    solution this time? Not allow flying. Smh. You screw something and your 
    solution is to screw it a bit more. Two wrongs don't make a right.<br><br>And 
    OK, I get you put a lot of effort on creating the garrison and that's why 
    you want to shove it down our throats, but I guess there must be some 
    pretty annoyed designers over there having created beautiful places like 
    Karabor and Bladespire and giving us generic stuff placed beside a 
    horribly designed battleground.<br><br>Sure, i am (according to blue 
    poster Lore) &#8220;still able to explore them, they&#8217;ll still be fully 
    populated, and they&#8217;re still going to be every bit as beautiful as they 
    would have been with a Transmog NPC.&#8221; But who does &#8220;explore&#8221; them, really? 
    Well, I guess I can go there while my Garrison plays the game for me.<br><br>Thank

 </div>I am playing this game for a while now but I have never witnessed SO MANY of my friends in battlenet being offline for DAYS and almost always disconnecting in mere hours.Personal experience, me and my girlfriend were hardcore WoW players. I can be a cynical bastard at times, I had the thought of getting imprisoned in garrison with no one around to see, doing dailies and spamming a bunch of boring heroics 24/7 were kinda killing my fun for a while... But today when my Blizzard obsessed girlfriend whose barely logged off this game since WOTLK woke up and told me &quot;I am not feeling to play WoW at all today...&quot; and played something else instead...it really made me think that the expansion already ran out of fun. Another hardcore PvP freak friend who wasted nights over this game bought WoD and I couldnt see him online again after that login attempt. And the list goes on with so many &quot;Last login more than a week&quot; guys all over...Out of all my huge friend list I have 3-4 constantly online brave souls SITTING IN THEIR GARRISONS AFK 24/7. No one is there farming transmogs anymore...Hell being in an RP server, even Stormwind Church has less people than ever.I have seen others complaning about situation on Trade Chat lately, your average gaming trash's reply to them was &quot;Go play something else&quot;. What can I do?! I love WoW. Its the only MMO I can play with huge player database. But I just cant FORCE myself to do inn dailies anymore. I COULDNT EVEN FINISH MY DAILY HERB AND MINING TOURS TODAY! By god, what has happened to this game? I have never seen WoW so isolated, boring and out of content before...

 <br /> 
 <br />Really? It sure feels like they are getting ready for it. 
</blockquote> 
<br /> 
<br />I told this before and Im saying it again : 
<br /> 
<br />WoD is not an expansion designed for user experience in first place. To us players, its just another TBC with content and a few additions. 
<br /> 
<br />What Blizzard really aimed with this expansion were 
<em>economical and player database stability.</em> 
<br /> 
<br />Face the fact, Blizzard and WoW lost so many players since Vanilla. The WC3 nostalgia they implanted aimed towards attaching those lost souls back to game. For example : 
<br /> 
<br />I bought WoD from a local store. The guy working the shop was a Vanilla-to-Cata WoW player. He always amazed at me about &quot;how Im still playing that game with everything ruined to core&quot;. Yet when I went in there to get WoD, the guy already pre-ordered it and was asking me which side to roll... 
<br /> 
<br />Yes, the plan probably worked and subs increased but it wont keep like this forever, especially in the patheticly boring state the game is in. If it goes like this untill March, they will keep bleeding subs MORE THEN EVER. Eventually, path to F2P will open. Yes they may have the most players in MMO genre but this is clearly not enough for Blizzard... 
<br /> 
<br />My guess is that Garrison expansion will fail what Blizzard seems to achieve, they will lose the subs to boredom they gathered by nostalgia. Eventually at the end of this expansion, they will have no more option than going Free To Play along with next expansion. Hell IM SURE they will use the excuse of F2P to attach more players. 
<br /> 
<br />This will probably how Chris Metzen explain things in next years Blizzcon while sweating and shaking as ever : 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<blockquote>
  DEEP BELOW! NAGA EXPANSION! OLD GODS! AZSHARA!....WAIIIIT FOR IIIIT! AFTER YEARS OF PLAYING WE ARE REWARDING PLAYERS WIIITH.....FREE TO PLAY! TOTALLY! We are also giving our beloved paid customers &quot;The Veteran&quot; title! WOOOHOOO! 
 <br /> 
 <br />&quot;Awkward Silence followed by braindead clappings and WOOHOOO&quot; 
</blockquote>","2014-12-08 11:16:00"
149,140,"684f5be7d8b1b2f7","Well, I like and do not like WoD. 
<br /> 
<br />I like the beautiful world, the storylines, the variety of areas, mobs and characters. I like the concept of Garrisons. I like the challenging HCs. 
<br /> 
<br />However... 
<br />I do not like the time-based content. It feels very cheap and it feels as if it was pulled from a 500k dollars budget FTP game. 
<br />You want Apexis crystals? Do the daily. You want more? You can wait another day, or grind mobs that give you 1 crystal each. 1 CRYSTAL! 
<br />On top of that, they are absolutely useless. Why? Well, you use Apexis Crystals to buy gear, which is crap, since dungeons, and lately Highmaul provide alot better gear with much easier effort. 
<br />You can also buy Mounts and followers using Apexis crystals, but the !@#$ part is that you won't actually have the chance to buy them, since you are gated by the stupid-long %^- rep grind. 
<br /> 
<br />Dungeons are preety unrewarding. I know I still am not fully upgraded, however there is no incentive to run dungeons after you are fully geared. Why should I run a dungeon once I'm lvl 630? To have a chance for extra 6 ilvl? No thank you, I can do normal Highmaul and get better. For the garrison resources? Nty Lumber Mill has that covered up. And it's a real shame since this set of dungeons is the best since... a very long time. 
<br /> 
<br />I don't PVP but from what people and my friends tell me it's absolutely rubbish. Won't say more... 
<br /> 
<br />Grinding reputations is done in the *!@#tiest way possible. I know that they are not mandatory, but seriousely, it's absurd to kill 9999999 mobs in order to get extalted. Bring back dailies, and dungeon tabards. More precisely, bring back CHOICES! We don't have a choice to build up our reputation; blizzard just throws it in our $%^. 
<br /> 
<br />Professions are destroyed. Mining is destroyed. Herbalism is destroyed. Everything is done by the system of waiting. You have to wait to get the epic shards from enchanting. You have to wait to upgrade your enchanting skill. You have to wait to craft that epic helm. You have to wait... 
<br /> 
<br />Also, why they decided to scrap the Isle of Giants way of farming mounts? Instead, we have this idiot camping in which we waste days for a mount that will be steamrolled in SECONDS once it spawns because Blizzard was unable to give sufficient health to that mob. I much prefered the bone collecting from Isle of Giants. It was a long grind, but you could've logged on, do your business, go to Isle of giants, farm 999 bones, and return tomorrow or any other day, and it wasn't absurd... 
<br /> 
<br />Imo, the developers have decided to put up these kind of gating content because they have too little content to display on WoD, so they decided to limit our progression in order to not finish the content really fast, which would make us bored to the tears like it happened in DS, SoO etc. 
<br />Bad news is, they didn't achieve this. We are still a bored. 
<br /> 
<br />PS : Why blizzard has to shift polarity. Why they can't find a middle ground that will satisfy us all?","2014-12-08 11:23:00"
149,141,"9b00ffcbea679c6f","I don't understand why they decided to destroy the trading/economy part of the game by making everyone almost self-sufficient with garrisons. At least I would go out in the world to farm for my profs and tried to cash in before this expansion.","2014-12-08 11:27:00"
149,142,"1bcbbf2e92ae680e","But all MMOs get to be dreary and boring in the end. Not one of them is sufficiently dynamic to the point of giving players something different to do. MMOs are just habit forming, and there is always a fear of getting left behind. Once you get over that fear there really is nothing much worth playing for. And that applies to all of the games. It really is a case of been there done that. I guess the game makers know that also. They have pretty well exhausted everything there is to do with point click and pick up. 
<br /> 
<br />Sadly there will be no next gen, because players want in and out and fast and furious and will move where the crowds are going. All the games generally are suffering at the moment. All it will take is for a telephone app. to become popular and you wont se players for dust. In truth, these games are way too much of a time sink. Added to the fact the day of the PC is over. Gaming will have to be free eventually, and money will be made from junk and advertising. Thats the way of things. 
<br /> 
<br />PS Its not Blizzards fault. It is the players fault. In the end we all get the games we deserve. That is why classic was so wonderful. It was fresh new and we hungered for that content. The games creators were in sync with an emerging growing community who wanted to support the game. When you have climbed the mountain, reached your citidal, taken the crown and basked in the glory what then? What do you do when the war is over. 
<br /> 
<br />Personally I enjoy my gaming. Long may it last. Getting harder though I have to say.","2014-12-08 11:32:00"

149,144,"e5f9251cfd6c0993","I am looking forward to raiding a bit more. But will be honest even tho WOD is nice, it is getting boring already. 
<br />Usually I rush to level alts to max level but I just don't have the heart to do it. 
<br />I have spent a huge amount of time in my garrison on missions etc. More time than I ever thought I would. 
<br />Yet it feels liks blizz punishes your hard work on getting followers very high, as it then offers you barely any missions for your 100's. Then they nerf the crates for low missions. That was a knock for me 
<br /> 
<br />Now I do not have the heart to leveling a alt with garrison followers. For me it was fun first time only maybe. 
<br /> 
<br />I don't know, I have this char geared to 640 now and will do a bit of raiding, but It does feel like my days with wow is numbered. That is not a i am cancelling my sub threat. It is just me saying I am maybe not enjoying it as much as I hoped. 
<br /> 
<br />Far too many problems with bugs and class changes. My fave class which is a lock just feels a fraction of how fun it used to be. The game has been amazing and in a lot of ways WOD is great. But maybe it has run its course with me a bit. 
<br /> 
<br />What I will say is MOP running as long as it has, did not help. It left you burnt out on wow a bit. 
<br /> 
<br />So yea in some ways WOD better than Cata and MOP in some ways, but story wise omg its boring!!! Bring back Wrath story telling please! The story and villians just do not feel scary or epic compared to likes of LK 
<br /> 
<br />The Iron horde was really over hyped by blizz big time... In some ways it feels a bit panto in reality.","2014-12-08 11:36:00"

<br /> 
<br />Ah yeah. I was kinda thinking about it, as being that &quot;lost soul&quot; and hype around WoD. 
<br /> 
<br />I know that kinda expectations, never meet reality but that i actually was hoping for. 
<br /> 
<br />1. Draenor by it's size same as Kalimdor atleast. 
<br /> 
<br />2. I honestly didn't expect class ability pruning, i thought there will be new and cool spells with awesome ideas behind it. Not some 4 passives which applied randomly. 
<br /> 
<br />3. I thought there will be new professions, i honestly didn't expected they would screw old once and lock everything with this stupid gating. 
<br /> 
<br />4. I thought there will be way more love put into new model character creation. 
<br /> 
<br />5. I really didn't thought they will give so much attention to the graphics thou, graphics was always the downside of WoW, but it didn't matter since the game was played for it's gameplay. 
<br /> 
<br />6. I knew about garrisons, but oh dear lord, this thing is i just don't know, it's like time wasting addiction with out any real accomplishment and real depth inside of it. It's not even carrot on the stick it's just well... i have no words. 
<br /> 
<br />7. I thought the leveling wouldn't take me 1-2 days to get max level. 
<br /> 
<br />8. Reputation grinds was like one of the worst things in vanilla, i haven't expect them to go into the past and apply those boring time sinks. 
<br /> 
<br />9. I thought WPvP would happen the natural way like it was before, when zones are clustered with Horde/alliance bases, with shared objectives, with slower leveling, so when one person get killed more and more players jump into confrontation. 
<br /> 
<br />10. Ashran, really boring Escort/Fragment/AoE combo with ton of bugs/lags/queues with out any real reason to do BG-like zone, with out real outcome and being forced, to cap CP.

I stopped doing the Apex dailies after I had enough for the legendary quest line.

  <br />Arena and RBG season just started so for anyone who claims themselves a PvP player, there's this. 
  <br /> 
  <br />Raid content is underway and Highmaul so far is an incredibly fun raid with good mechanics. 
  <br /> 
  <br />Challenge modes! Running your daily non-rated or bronze challenge modes is all fine and dandy, but that's not all that challenging after all. Get a group and try your hand at gold ratings. Reaching those timers is going to push you and your group to the limits of your performance, and it's a nice project to undertake if you feel the game offers no difficulty. 
  <br /> 
  <br />There's no overabundance of dailies no more because the Pandaria situation caused a major outrage, and it seems Blizzard put instead a different, more old school system for getting your reputations up. Go ahead and farm them. 
  <br /> 
  <br />Garrisons, Garrisons, Garrisons. Not everyone seems to enjoy them in this thread which is a loss because a huge part of the expansion revolves around the town of your own. I, however, can't get enough of these follower missions, leveling all of them to epic and upgrading their item level is a fun thing for me which doesn't take up too much of my time.

  <br />Explore the new world. Draenor is a beautiful continent and there's a lot to discover. Rare treasures, rare spawns, followers scattered across the world, many of all of that accompanied by cool vanity events, there's plenty to see and plenty to find in Draenor. 
  <br /> 
  <br />Then of course all the older content is still there for all of you pet trainers, achievement hunters, mount collectors, toy-makers, gold hoarders, transmog fashion designers, dungeon crawlers... 
  <br /> 
  <br />I have always felt this game is what you make it. There's a lot of content out there and it never seems to run dry if you have a bunch of friends or a guild that intends to make it a fun and full filling experience. We are having a blast in our guild progressing through the new raid content and we've kept ourselves occupied this past month with guild dungeon runs, guild battlegrounds, guild challenge modes (both daily and gold attempts), guild farm groups, helping and assisting each other. 
  <br /> 
  <br />A good guild of people that are fun to hang out with makes more content than anything else, but for those of you somewhat lacking in the guild department, the rehashed Group Finder tool is a godsend because it made players more sociable. Whichever group I joined so far (and I joined a lot of them) was fun and talkative who enjoyed doing whatever they set out to do with each other.

 <br /> 
 <br />Yeah, there IS the garrison and ONLY the garrison. Blizzard just doesn't get that choice is a good thing. 
 <br />Why not have a few dailies, the garrison, rep tabards, the challenge modes and so on? Nope! It's this ONE thing every expantion and nothing else! If people happen to not like this ONE thing than they will leave. How is this good design? 
 <br /> 
 <br />Explore? What is there to explore? Add to that, with the removal of flying mounts at max level, going outside is a chore that many find takes away alot of the fun in exploring what little is there.

<br />That's as may be, but doesn't explain why I'm bored, having played far LESS the last 2 weeks than I've ever played in the first several months of an expansion before. I just struggle to find motivation to log in for anything other than garrison missions. This feels like it usually feels in the long wait before a new expansion, not like we're only 3 weeks into the release of a new one, it's just so limited in what there is to do out in the world. 
<br /> 
<br />Yes, some smartarse will look at my armory and say I haven't done raids, heroics, blah blah - I didn't 
<em>have</em> to do those to have fun in past expansions! Maybe MoP spoilt me; it had tons of content for my playstyle, and I got used to having plenty to do, now it's back to Cata days, except it feels worse after so long of having content which suits me (and even Cata had a BIT more to do). Raid Finder will help when it comes out on Wednesday, but that's still only a few hours filled per week, plus I'm not a person who can stand farming the same content for too long, so once I've done it a few times, that'll be it. 
<br /> 
<br />Just feels like this expansion came out half finished; the levelling questlines feel so well polished, I loved them, but at 100, it feels like they didn't bother doing anything really, just throw a few repgrinds in, that'll do. Evidently it's enough to keep some people happy, but I personally am very disappointed: this expansion had a lot of potential for interesting storylines and content, but it's not happened in endgame yet.","2014-12-08 13:55:00"

<br />I hit level 100 and that's when things started to feel a bit drab, Garrisons I don't like, it's boring and feels forced. I have the inn and have done a few of the quests but I'm not really one for dungeons so that is boring and feels forced too. PVP I do like but Ashran is absolutely horrible and has turned out exactly how I hoped it wouldn't.

<br />

<br />One thing I will say is the PVP really isn't for me anymore. I didn't like the idea of ability pruning but tried to think of how it might make it more interesting, but I just feel like all my classes are the same just repainted.

<br /> 
<br />All of these Supporters which have been there before, go farming, do professions and so on for fun are useless and I think mostly gone. Replaced by lifeless NPC. Like me. 
<br />I loved flying around, farming ores and herbs, disenchant items I didn't need, prospeting, milling, creating new things. Only for one reason: to support my guild. My friends who love to go raiding and instances, but mostly had no sense for farming and professions. 
<br />But it was fine like that. I used to be a filler for raids when someone was missing, because I don't like raiding this much. Was not on the last places, mostly somewhere in the middle, but after a hard day at work, I don't like to have stress raiding. So I filled up guild bank and when I was asked to help raiding I got some nice Items and all where happy. 
<br /> 
<br />Now... I'm really really useless. 
<br />Before WoD I was able to support a complete 25 man raid, inclusive all who weren't with us every week. So there are 50-60 Players. I got some help with materials, but it was not necessary, I really was able to do all gems, enchants, flask, bufffood, pots on my own for this mass of players. 
<br />Now... nothing left... I'm barely able to support 5 players on my own. Not even with 13 characters... not a little chance. 
<br /> 
<br />So I did the only thing left for me: I suspended my account two weeks ago and look into the game one or two times a week, looking for the guild, saying hi and log out, because I have gametime left. 
<br />I really really like my guild, this is the only point why I read all patchnotes, hotfix notes and so on, hoping for better times. I really would like to play with my friends, but feeling so damn useless for my guild and unwanted by blizz is so much not fun, that I decided to play another things and say hi in teamspeak and sometimes this few minutes ingame. 
<br />

<br />You're an idiot thinking Cata/MoP was better then WoD. You are really mis-informed about everything are you?. Cata was the worst expansion pack we ever had. 1/2mil subs went down and in MoP it continued to decline to 6.8. WoD increased that by 3.2mil. Why? Players fel Mop was more like a job. 30 dailies a day was not nice. Blizzard had to improvise mid half of the expansion, giving us timeless isle, no quests only an adventure we could go into and discover treasures, get rares for rewards. Even blizzard admitted this and learnt from the daily mistake. WoD has only 2-3 dailies, and you are not obliged to do them..

    For me, it's all in the wording.<br><br>I found the leveling-experience 
    extremely enjoyable. The quests, the zones, the cutscenes, it was all 
    great. And a bit different, because of the garrison and the outposts.<br>I 
    like the garrison, the followers, the buildings and the missions. (I would 
    want them to be accountwide though.)<br>The dungeons have been nice and 
    for the most part fun (the three weeks I felt the need to do them).<br>Highmaul 
    is great.<br>The garrison campaign, that gives a small questline or two 
    each week, is something I really enjoy, and I hope something like that can 
    continue throughout the expansion.<br>I like the pet menagerie a lot, it's 
    been a real challenge some days!<br><br>I think the daily Apexis Crystal 
    &quot;quest&quot; is ok-ish. Running around in a big 40people zerg-group is 
    certainly not my kind of fun, but it's fair enough.<br>I enjoy the 
    invasions less than what I thought I would after doing the first one. So 
    now I'm saving the one I have available until reset, so that I can get a 
    new gold bag.<br>I had fun going treasure-hunting! And I freaking love 
    Aviana's Feather. My advice would be to stagger the treasures a bit. Don't 
    make them all available week 1, leave some for later.<br><br>I would have 
    liked some hubs with daily quests (aimed towards the reputations). Perhaps 
    with a choice (&quot;you can quest in two hubs only each day&quot;?), so that people 
    wouldn't burn themselves out.<br>I miss 3people scenarios.<br>Professions... 
    Haven't looked into all, only Alch, Inscr, Cooking, Archy, Fishing, First 
    Aid. For cooking, I really thought the Ironpaw Token at Halfhill was 
    great, and I would like to see that continued.<br><br>I have been playing 
    a lot. So I was starting to feel like I had run out of stuff (that I 
    wanted to do/try). So I came to the forum to see if others are feeling the 
    same way, and if there are good suggestions/solutions. I wasn't sure if I 
    had just played too much and gone through stuff too quickly (which I 
    probably did), or if there was a general feeling of &quot;not that much to do&quot;. 
    And then I see &quot;the game sucks&quot;, it's &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;easy&quot;, with long rants, 
    foul language and insults thrown in any direction. And that just makes me 
    not want to come to the forum anymore. Cause the statements are so 
    ignorant, shortsighted and black/white that I just want to give up. It's 
    still an amazing game!

<br />You are clueless. I write something, you change the topic and the cycle continues. Casual players dumbed down the game and now they want nerfs, sharing their casual experience ingame, on how WoD boring is. lol ofc it is, I look at every casual achievements/logs, they didnt even ones tried CMs/PVP/Raids, only a little bit of the LFR system.

10178,55,"b5394be0ba0b93d9","Overall I am satisfied with Warlord of Draenor, but there are certainly improvements that can be made to the game. And I do feel that garrisons, whilst they are a fantastic idea overall, have some issues that need to be addressed. 
<br /> 
<br />For example, I think the herb gardens and mine was a bad idea. Instead of directly giving you trade materials, they should have instead given you exclusive garrison materials for work orders on other buildings. That way you don't mess around with professions and the way the auction house market has worked for 10 years. 
<br /> 
<br />I am quite happy with how no-flying has turned out, but they need to keep the open world relevant and interesting if being grounded is to remain interesting. As soon as they stop doing that, being grounded will begin to become a chore. 
<br /> 
<br />The rare Poundfist, which driops the Sunnhide Gronnling mount, has created an interesting community dynamic in this game, which is something we have not really seen since the days of Time Lost Proto Drake. Except now, we have the cross-realm group finder which has enabled people from different servers to coordinate and come together for this mount, and make new friends. I think that is good. 
<br /> 
<br />Which leads me to the next reason I am loving WoD so far: the Group Finder. This is an awesome tool they added to the game. Yes it always existed of course, but it became slowly redundant due to its lack of cross realm capabilities. Now it was built with cross realm in mind, and its absolutely fantastic. 
<br /> 
<br />Highmaul is proving to be loads more fun than I thought it would be. As my friends who follow me on Twitter would have noticed, I was dreading Highmaul because frankly, Siege of Origrmmar killed raiding for me. I wanted to just give up before we've even started, because I wasn't sure if Highmaul was going to be my thing. But boy, it certainly is more fun now that Blizzard doesn't have to balance a raid around 10 as well as 25man setups. My guild started with Mythic tonight, I could not go because of IRL, but I am thoroughly looking forward to our next week runs on Mythic. 
<br /> 
<br />As for classes, I will speak in terms of feral druids. Whilst ferals are not weak at all by any stretch of the imagination, they are not fun to play. The reason for that is because we became more about burst and auto attacks and less about bleed damage. I don't really like this change. It has made playing this spec less fun for me. But that is subjective. 
<br /> 
<br />Just my random thoughts about this expansion. Again I am satisfied with it, but they can definitely make improvements. I think as a first impression, it did good.","2014-12-16 20:23:00"

Blizzard had to improvise mid half of the expansion, giving us timeless isle, no quests only an adventure we could go into and discover treasures, get rares for rewards.

</blockquote> 
<br /> 
<br />Okay, first behave yourself and do you research before posting a reply. Cata was bad because of the constant nerfs we had on the content, and the lack of content we got in the Dragon Soul patch, hence why the subscribers went down, however it did have 12 mil subscribers at the start. At the end of cata there was 9 mil subscribers which is still pretty good even though it went down. MoP the subscribers went up to 10 mil because it was a new expansion and a lot of old players resubbed. However like cata we had a content draught in the end which resulted in a lot of subscribers saying bye bye. 
<br /> 
<br />Do you see the pattern here? A lot of returning players come back to the game when a new expac is out, however a lot of people have been complaining about this expansion and I predict that 10mil is going to be WoD peak. I'm a fanboy? no I'm not, I am an example of a returning player that is very unsatisfied of what I have been served as an &quot;expansion&quot;. 
<br /> 
<br />And you still don't understand the dailies mechanic, in MoP the problem was you had to do them for gear, also for rep. In WoD, the dailies, they don't grant you rep, to get rep you have to manually farm mobs 1 by 1 endlessy until you are exalted. Do you understand??

<br />Cataclsym as an expansion lacked features. Designing/Developments was mostly focused on revamping azeroth zones (useless for end game) so when you dinged 85. You had to do rep farm for epic items followed by heroics and then install gearscore addon and then spam trade chat for pugs. MoP was Cata 2.0 where you had twice as much dailies and everything was a faceroll, no CC during MoP HC dungeons, OP warlocks, which had no change during for the whole expansion. 6.0 Had dailies, 6.1 Had dailies. 6.2 had dailies and blizzard changed their mind mid expansion as dailies did not work. I remember million posts regarding this stupid idea of spamming dailies. MoP was great with Challege Modes/Brawlers Guild but on the other had MoP had the worst decline. Statistics don't lie. Cata from my experience was a filler also MoP too. WoD feels different, I feel more important in draenor due to garrisons, and I hate when people look black and white about WoD. 
<br /> 
<br />WoD has many features, but what I only see, lets say Challenge Mode is a great feature though 80% of the *whiners* didn't even try CMs. Casual players will not try CM of course because their main excuse is that they don't have the time. So quit the game, and stop dumbing down the game more.","2014-12-16 22:29:00"

  Cataclsym as an expansion lacked features. Designing/Developments was mostly focused on revamping azeroth zones (useless for end game) so when you dinged 85. You had to do rep farm for epic items followed by heroics and then install gearscore addon and then spam trade chat for pugs. MoP was Cata 2.0 where you had twice as much dailies and everything was a faceroll, no CC during MoP HC dungeons, OP warlocks, which had no change during for the whole expansion. 6.0 Had dailies, 6.1 Had dailies. 6.2 had dailies and blizzard changed their mind mid expansion as dailies did not work. I remember million posts regarding this stupid idea of spamming dailies. MoP was great with Challege Modes/Brawlers Guild but on the other had MoP had the worst decline. Statistics don't lie. Cata from my experience was a filler also MoP too. WoD feels different, I feel more important in draenor due to garrisons, and I hate when people look black and white about WoD. 
</blockquote> 
<br />You can see that the detail in MoP, the design too, more effort was put into it than WoD, fair enough Garrisons is the big feature, but what did it cost? We got no Scenarios, no new mechanics for classes, no new classes/race either. Cata at the start had some very hard heroic dungeons. MoP never did because of the introduction of Challenge Modes. The stats do not lie, but the stats you see are those of the previous expansion launch till the end, WoD just started a month ago, and I know that the sub stats will decrease. Blizzard made the same mistake with the last three expansions, and that is dragging the final raid tier for such a long time, hence why theres such a big sub loss in that period.

  WoD has many features, but what I only see, lets say Challenge Mode is a great feature though 80% of the *whiners* didn't even try CMs. Casual players will not try CM of course because their main excuse is that they don't have the time. So quit the game, and stop dumbing down the game more.

<br />I'm with this guy^. ad7a15e6a7ab1c2c has been digging too many holes for himself in this discussion. Plus.. 35f8e65d505e418a is a fellow tabard of the protector achiever. Having that tabard means that what we say goes, and everyone without it should be bound by law to kiss our rings. I also want to underline that for us, the game was already two years old when achievements were brought in. 
<br /> 
<br />I'd say the majority of players that have been around since beta/release have been hardcore in some aspect. Just because we can't throw up some Mythic achievement from this expansion doesn't mean we can't throw up older ones. I got fed up with raiding as it never surprises anymore (quit entirely after MSV normal in MoP), practicing PvP through the rest of it. Little did I know that WoD would be such a clusterf*ck in terms of class balance that it almost feels wasted. 
<br />

<br />Generic. Same thing every day. You cripple yourself for professions or raiding if you don't do it. People will argue it's optional. Well guess what. Going past level one is optional. Using a mount to get around is optional. It's an open world Mmo everything is technically optional. That arguement could be applied to literally any QQ associated with the game. It's not constructive. It's a twisted truth used to derail a point you don't agree with. Seriously every time someone says it I picture a kappa face not even joking. It's not even open world anymore is it. It's world of garrisons. 
<br /> 
<br />Just to be 100% clear I wouldn't mind them being so central to the game of they were actually interesting. 
<br /> 
<br />The reality is. Sub par, single player, grindy and generic content stands between the average player and what they hope to achieve in the game. Whether it's pvp, pve.... Whatever. You can take the smooth dull coma inducing motorway of the Garrisons to your destination. Or you can hike barefoot through the Mountains to get there. It's definately more scenic and maybe more interesting. But it takes 372 days for you to arrive. The entire time your friends were pimping it up in Las Vegas for months. They were hanging out with Dan Bilzerian. But you missed it. 
<br /> 
<br />&quot;Totally optional dude, walk barefoot through the mountains&quot; 
<br /> 
<br />NO. THIS IS BAD DESIGN. *depph bref* 
<br /> 
<br />I'm going to end my rant now. I suppose I should end with a more constructive and rationalised thingy. Paragraph I guess. 
<br />I don't want Garrisons to be taken away from people who enjoy them. And I think there should be some rewards for people who put so much work into something. 
<br />The transmogs, free bonus roll, Mage tower, private AH, increased mount speed whatever. All good. Free BoP consumables would be another great addition. 
<br />But this feature should not be the only reasonable road to what you want to do in this game. It should be one of many roads to Las Vegas. Instead there is only one. Alternative. Walk barefoot (&quot;STILL OPTIONAL M80&quot; &lt;-- /sigh)

I don't like the fact that mining and herbalism are two extremely watered-down professions now and I really don't want to run the Lunarfart Excavation once a day on all my alts. Nor do I wish to spend several thousands of gold on plans to upgrade my garrison buildings to level 3 on all my alts. Yet; I feel as if I can't progress as much as I want if I don't. 
<br /> 
<br />I've made a bit of gold selling Shredirons Shredder and other items. If I had been arsed to bother with my alts garrisons I would have been able to make 5-10 Shredirons Shredders by now and made even more gold. But the tediousness of the garrison dailies is just unparallelled, while I intend to level all my alts to level 100. I've felt almost forced to do it now before 3rd of December to get as much out of the professions as possible before the raiding starts and the prices plummet.

<br />However, I do see a resemblance to the garrison and FarmVille. 
<br />Blizzard has been notorious in the past to copy whatever in the gaming world seems popular. take a look at WOTLK. Shortly before WOTLK was announced, Microsoft announced achivements for xbox live. Blizzard jumped on that wagon and for a long time, people wondered what these achivement points were actually good for. Some said they could be traded for mounts and other goodies. 
<br /> 
<br />It's Blizzard in a nutshell to create ideas out of what seems to be popular at this spot. FarmVille has had great success on the internet that past couple of years, so I'm ot surprised that we'd see something like it.

 <br /> 
 <br />However, I do see a resemblance to the garrison and FarmVille. 
 <br />Blizzard has been notorious in the past to copy whatever in the gaming world seems popular. take a look at WOTLK. Shortly before WOTLK was announced, Microsoft announced achivements for xbox live. Blizzard jumped on that wagon and for a long time, people wondered what these achivement points were actually good for. Some said they could be traded for mounts and other goodies.

<br /> 
<br />Agreed. 
<br /> 
<br />Also i just remembered. Housing. Blizz didnt want to implement just housing...but for some reason i think garrison is some sort of housing replacement. Now my point is..when i first raid i get my own castle i wa slike &quot;OMG COOL&quot; and then i quickly got back on my feet and thought &quot;..where is the negative point now?&quot; 
<br /> 
<br />the garrison has absolutely 0 customizability. Its such a shame. Not race-like stuff. No vast majority of buildings. Just a selected few with samish look, daily cooldowns tied to it. This reminds me actually of smartphone games where you place your lil* 4 inch building and it looks kinda cool...for 5 seconds. 
<br />There could be so much more..and yet there is nothing. In my head it still WANTS to be a cool idea, but ingame its just so..dumb","2014-12-03 02:15:00"

<br /> 
<br />This is a can of worms but yeh I agree with it. Normal/hc gear from missions I don't really mind. But for me I think hard mode gear should only be obtainable from hard mode bosses. It's not even a I don't want other people to have nice things attitude or an elitist thing. 
<br /> 
<br />More from a traditionalist sort of thing. You kill the big dragon and you get the loot. Getting it through the Garrison is just.... I dunno. I feel the same way about legendaries too. I'm in a guild with 30 people, if there were a legendary obtainable only in raids I would not get it. I'd still prefer that system to come back than the everybodies a winner sort of approach. Epics should be epic and legendaries, legendary. 
<br /> 
<br />If a guy on your server had double war glaives you knew who the hell he was. 
<br /> 
<br />Mythic gear in garrisons just seems so against that whole idea. Slay the dragon with your friends, get the loot. Play candy crush on your own, get the loot? :/ 
<br /> 
<br />Hard to not come across as a douche when I'm someone who gets that kind of gear. But yeh. Not apologising for that Id feel the same if I stopped raiding.","2014-12-03 03:03:00"

 <br />This is a can of worms but yeh I agree with it. Normal/hc gear from missions I don't really mind. But for me I think hard mode gear should only be obtainable from hard mode bosses. It's not even a I don't want other people to have nice things attitude or an elitist thing. 
 <br /> 
 <br />More from a traditionalist sort of thing. You kill the big dragon and you get the loot. Getting it through the Garrison is just.... I dunno. I feel the same way about legendaries too. I'm in a guild with 30 people, if there were a legendary obtainable only in raids I would not get it. I'd still prefer that system to come back than the everybodies a winner sort of approach. Epics should be epic and legendaries, legendary. 
 <br /> 
 <br />If a guy on your server had double war glaives you knew who the hell he was. 
 <br /> 
 <br />Mythic gear in garrisons just seems so against that whole idea. Slay the dragon with your friends, get the loot. Play candy crush on your own, get the loot? :/ 
 <br /> 
 <br />Hard to not come across as a douche when I'm someone who gets that kind of gear. But yeh. Not apologising for that Id feel the same if I stopped raiding.

<br /> 
<br />That comment was directed towards the idea of mythic gear dropping from missions. I frankly don't care if it rains normal gear. My point was that the hardest gear shouldn't be in that rain, for me that's too far. 
<br /> 
<br />As for legendaries only the glaives were RNG anything else a guild funnelled the items into 1-2 players that's not RNG. That is deliberate. 
<br /> 
<br />Ok for example. The plate shoulders from garrosh, tusks of mannoroth. 0.07% drop chance on the last boss of an expansion. That's cool, even if it's rng. The 6 cloaks? Possibly the 6 most common pieces of gear in the game period. That's not legendary it's mandatory. A raider in your group with a legendary should be a powerhouse. The cloak was a requirement to join literally any raiding guild in 5.4. Not a nice little bonus, mandatory. As in application declined. 
<br /> 
<br />To me that is bs, there need to be some things that are extremely rare or powerful in the game. It's an RPG.","2014-12-03 03:24:00"

</blockquote> 
<br /> 
<br />You can't get the fractured crystal thingies (can't remember what they're called and don't really care) for enchanting, 10 of which make a whole crystal. 
<br /> 
<br />So, you then only have a chance at getting a whole crystal, once a day (you may not even get a whole one) and you need at least 4 of them for every decent quality enchant. 
<br /> 
<br />So, it severely limits you. 
<br /> 
<br />TBH, the whole enchanting thing probably needs adjustment, anyway, as you don't even get many of the fractured ones from a level 2 enchanting building, per day, even when you tend to make new work orders as soon as the old ones expire. 
<br /> 
<br />The mine means you get plenty of ore and the herb garden the same, but getting a half decent quantity of the right enchanting mats is hard work. 
<br /> 
<br />Of course, this may all change with the opening of the raids, IDK.","2014-12-03 03:26:00"

<br /> 
<br />My problem with it is that it forces people to do the content, even if they don't want to, to try to get the gear. 
<br /> 
<br />If, for example, the very occasional piece of Mythic quality gear dropped from absolutely any mob (i.e. not a world boss, or a rare - any mob) out in the world, then it would be fine. 
<br /> 
<br />As no one would feel forced to do content they wouldn't otherwise do, because it would be completely unfarmable. 
<br /> 
<br />But, when it is tied to the garrison, it makes people feel they are mandatory. 
<br /> 
<br />TBH, I quite like the garrison, but what ruins it for me is that it is required content; not entirely optional. 
<br /> 
<br />I didn't, on the other hand, have a problem with the legendary cloak being farmable in LFR, because if you enjoy raiding, the only real reason to disapprove of LFR (and people getting their legendary via LFR) is snobbery. 
<br /> 
<br />Doing LFR wasn't mandatory to farm the items for the legendary - you could also farm them in other difficulties. 
<br /> 
<br />So, it's not the same thing as this situation with garrisons, at all.","2014-12-03 03:36:00"

<br />I think there should be other ways for non-raiders (or more casual raiders) to get decent gear, too.

<br />There's nothing elitist about not enjoying being forced to do Blizzard's flavour of the month feature in order to compete. 
<br />Many people do not wish to plough their time and effort into their garrison, and it is acceptable for them to object to feeling forced into doing so. 
<br />World of Warcraft is an RPG first and foremost - that is the core of the game and the RPG elements are what the game should focus on. The minigames that Blizzard introduce are fun and engaging but they should not effect the outcome of the RPG at the heart of the game. 
<br /> 
<br />I personally very much enjoy the garrison, but can see that for those who wish to play World of Warcraft it is very frustrating to have to devote a huge amount of time and effort into the garrison minigames. 
<br /> 
<br />Imagine if you had to participate in pet battles to gain double crafting resources each day. I genuinely would be playing the game far less if that were the case - perhaps even stop altogether - and this must be how those who begrudgingly grind through the garrison system must be feeling.","2014-12-03 04:11:00"

<br /> 
<br />I don't want to restrict anything. There is a linear gearing path from LFR, normal, heroic &amp; mythic. By the time you progress through normal and heroic collecting your gear to get to mythic you are more experienced and skilled than when you started. And you're actually ready for it as a player. 
<br /> 
<br />I said 'skilled' but really it's just developing a muscle memory with your class but also mechanics in general. 
<br /> 
<br />You're pretending like gear is this huge thing for progressing in PvE, it is in the sense that more numbers = better. But you need the muscle memory as a raider to beat bosses and you can't get that sending followers on missions. You seem to think you need mythic gear to do mythic. That doesn't make sense..... At all. But anyway. 
<br />Again it basically comes down to. I don't think things that people work hard to obtain, should be obtained easily for bo reason in FarmVille. Hell, even a guy who buys a boost has earned mythic gear he gets. Because the gold he paid is a culmination of hundreds of hours of gameplay and dedication grinding gold. 
<br /> 
<br />Garrison aka free loot vendor I do not support. And again.... I really don't care what others have. But I think the way they get it should be through a little bit of effort. Elitist?","2014-12-03 05:31:00"

<br />This is 3 weeks in. Can you do the garrison stuff for another 2 years? I don't want it removed just alternatives in place for the same bonuses. I find it pretty comical that some of the other people in this thread think there should be multiple solutions to obtaining gear. But 0 compromise on the Garrison being shoved down our throats. I strongly.... Strongly. And I mean really. Dislike the work order system. But I don't even have the matts to make my own enchants let alone sell anything? 
<br /> 
<br />3k for +50 gems because of this broken prof system. Have four professions going into overdrive just to have 1 character raid ready. And I have to play this Zynga game to do it

<br /> 
<br />In theory he can, yes. 
<br /> 
<br />However, it actually really depends on how much competition there is for his raid spot. 
<br /> 
<br />If he just ignores the garrison, because he dislikes it and then someone with equal skills, but far better gear, shows up - of course the RL will tend to pick that person over him. 
<br /> 
<br />So, it does potentially threaten the rest of his game.

 <br /> 
 <br />In theory he can, yes. 
 <br /> 
 <br />However, it actually really depends on how much competition there is for his raid spot. 
 <br /> 
 <br />If he just ignores the garrison, because he dislikes it and then someone with equal skills, but far better gear, shows up - of course the RL will tend to pick that person over him. 
 <br /> 
 <br />So, it does potentially threaten the rest of his game. 
 <br /> 
 <br />I don't really see how that works, TBH, because even though I agree that getting better gear will help you complete questing and dungeon runs faster, it is never going to be a prerequisite for being allowed to do those activities.

  <br />But pet battles only gives you pets... How about we make it so garrisons only give you new stuff inside your garrison, such as new looks for your buildings, stuff like that. 
  <br />As it is now, if you want to raid or do CM you need to play farmvil... Ehm, I mean garrisons. 
  <br /> 
  <br />I'm hoping we'll get some form of addon that could make it all automatic so I don't have to sitt and sort out that boring crap every 4 hours or so. 
  <br />The guy at blizzard that came up with the idea - Fire him, please.

 <br /> 
 <br />How about no? As you can see plenty of people enjoy Garrisons, don't like it? Leave the game. 
 <br /> 
 <br />But you wont, you will just continue post your pointless elitist views and whine about how your forced to do a few clicks in your Garrison every day. It's part of the game now, it wont get changed, it wont be removed, and no amount of pooled tears from the minority will change that. 
 <br /> 
 <br />So why not either adapt and have fun or find a new game or better yet just keep your pointless raging and QQing to your elitist guilds so that like minded people will soothe you.

<br />I'm not &quot;elitist&quot;. What is &quot;elit&quot; about garrisons? And why are my views pontless and yours not? 
<br />Looking at most of the posts both here and on the US forums garrisons are not that well liked so, yeah.

<br />As I understand, garrisons is the answer to dailies, as to give you something to do besides raids and dungeons and I have to say I much much prefer it over boring dailies.

<br />Is it mandatory? I think yes it is, cause I already got 4 epics 645 ilvl from missions and 1 655 trinket from highmaul mission. But maybe in the first normal raid I will do I will replace half of them... Is as mandatory as dailies was in pandaria, although the people who prefer dailies instead will argue against. 
<br /> 
<br />I think garrisons is great feature for lot of people. At least in my guild, most people loved garrisons. There are many things that are mandatory in wow, including dungeons and raids. You either do them and progress or you ignore some of them and you progress slower.

I don't see why people would deny it, or why they keep saying the OP want the garrison removed because he so often stated that's not his intention, even in his first post alone he stated it many times. 
<br /> 
<br />Now I have some good hope for you: if gearing and professions go the same way as they have always done, they'll soon be very much subpar to anything gotten through dungeons (if we get any new ones at all) and raiding. Soon the garrisons will become obsolete (for gear farming). 
<br /> 
<br />I play the garrison game a lot, but I still have only one upgrade made with blacksmithing: the rest comes from running dungeons. You really do not miss as much as it seems at first, even though it's in your face all the time. You'll miss quests, stories, mounts, followers... but gear? Not that much at all. 
<br /> 
<br />Hopefully that makes you feel little better, you can ignore all of it if you don't care for anything else that comes from the garrison but gear. You'll probably outlevel any gear you can make sooner than you can make it. You are only one 640 piece behind on me, the 'hardcore' garrison farmer.","2014-12-03 08:58:00"
11554,102,"1bcbbf2e92ae680e","I thought garrison was going to be about building something meaningful in the game that was a creation of my own efforts just for my own enjoyment and amusement. I realised a long time ago that these things were just an end game farm, similar to Pandaria. This game suffers dreadful with this gear chasing nonsense and has for a long time funnelled players into endgame so they can do these endless, endless activities. The creators have a very narrow mind when it comes to such things. They fail to realise that players will actually keep doing something cus they enjoy it. And they also think that players are very keen to do group things like raids, guilds and dungeons so that this encourages more players to play the game. Hence a fear of giving real rewards to those that like to play solo. 
<br /> 
<br />I was really hoping that I could actually build something for the fun of it. Not the case. Its again is just about numbers. Endless bloody numbers. Are your numbers better than the other player numbers. Personally I have never cared. I played this game to enjoy the bloody game. And each expansion they have taken more of the interesting content away and driven players to endgame to do this moronic stuff. Personally I liked visiting the trainer, learning my specialist skills, not having quests signposted and having stones that limit the number of portals I can create. Having stacks of twenty things made bags important and caused you to manage your activities. Having to travel all over the map to do quests, without bloody phasing, made questing interesting. And progression through levelling should take more than four days, and this is my second to 100. Sad, but the daily replaced real content when the tournament was introduced in Wrath. That was the end of Warcraft as we knew it. Gone was the Jame's Guide and in came gearscore and achievements...... 
<br /> 
<br />Have fun for the next two years doing this cus being camped in Shattrath, Dalaran, Stormwind and now in your garrison sounds like its like where you are going to be living every day. Not something I will do or have ever done. 
<br /> 
<br />PS I am not knocking garrisons, they are a logical extension of this game. Its just that I was hoping for something else. Would have been wonderful to have built a Dimension in Warcraft. Never mind.","2014-12-03 09:00:00"

  <br />If he is in a guild that others see him only as a number (ilvl in this case) then this is his choice..to compete with other numbers. So he either do mandatory things to increase his number identity or he finds another guild that others see him as a person. 
  <br /> 
  <br />Sorry, but this was the case in every MMO. There always mandatory ways to increase your ilvl...dungeons, raids, crafting, dailies... you either do them all and get the best possible number or you ignore 1 or 2 of them and you get lower number than others. This was the case in every MMO and in every wow expansion. 
  <br /> 
  <br />Asking to remove the activities you don't like, in order to keep your number relevant with others by doing only activities you like, is not a logical request. 
  <br /> 
  <br />Again, he should find a guild that he is judged as a person/player. If he insist to be on a guild that he is judged as a number then do what it needs to increase his number. Is really that simple, because is just a game.

 <br /> 
 <br />i am gonna assume you just started playing the game when this expansion came? as you should know thats not how it works you dont just join a guild either if your gear isnt good, as it is atm you can be just as good a player and 9 out of 10 times people still pick the bad player with the better gear especialy now when the raiding havent started yet

<br /> 
<br />You can't please all the people, all the time, but anything that suits one group, or type, of player extremely well, while turning another group, or type, of player off the game almost entirely, is failing to meet its brief, to one degree or another. 
<br /> 
<br />Because the game is supposed to seem enjoyable, or at least bearable, to as many people as possible. 
<br /> 
<br />The same could have been said about (for example) raiding, pre-LFR. 
<br /> 
<br />Some people loved it, loved the elitism of &quot;real raiding&quot;, loved the prestige, loved the exclusiveness; but, other people (understandably) loathed it, so they introduced an alternative, a middle ground. 
<br /> 
<br />That's not to say garrisons are entirely wrong, or should be scrapped (just as &quot;real&quot; raiding wasn't scrapped in favour of LFR), but it's obvious they need to be looked at, again.

<br /> 
<br />Also those who want a mobile APP prove him right , its gives to much advantage its not optional its mandatory , profession , bonus seals , bonus raid drops as items or legendary quest items . 
<br />ETC ETC . 
<br /> 
<br />I used to log do a few missions , let some longer for the night and get over it . 
<br /> 
<br />But here it comes the change , my brother got to 100 a week later , he goes to school (i work) so he could spam missions more time during the day , he reached and surpassed me quickly . 
<br /> 
<br />I even once logged in the morning to restart missions before work ! (never did turn pc on in years in the morning) 
<br />I didnt ask my brother to spam missions for me cos he got 1 character i play 3 , just enter each hour all of them and spam missions for 10 15 minutes open crates and repeat is annoying . 
<br /> 
<br />Its like those FB games , farmvile etc , theyre addicting and i dont rlly like them to be honest . Garrisons are fun and nice , and everything , but those missions .... 
<br /> 
<br />The solutions could be : NEVER ever do an app that would be a breaking point . Or just cap missions a week , like 70-100 missions a week , so everyone can take theyre time doing it , and not fal behind . 
<br /> 
<br />they capped materials/professions everything which prevents someone not to grind and maxx out in 1 2 days . Which blocks progression giving time for everyone , same could be done here . Not so great but it works . 
<br /> 
<br />Or duno make the mission time increase each new mission and reset once a week . so each mission takes longer and longer . 
<br /> 
<br />I know it sound punishing , but really i think its bad design . 
<br /> 
<br />Last mission i did was yesterday evening , and the next i will do will be today in the evening , meanwhile someone did 10X that amount , and i dont want to wake up at night to reschedule them (did that when was young in EVE with theyre skillqueue) i dont want get into wow in early morning and setup a remote viewer for it .","2014-12-03 10:45:00"

<br /> 
<br />I'm afraid the garrisons will be boring too after a while but for now I enjoy them. At least this is a new way to do grindy stuff. I don't think it is ever possible to include non-grindy stuff that lasts for long enough, and the alternative would be more daily quests and more mobs to kill and other repetitive things that this genre is really about. I hate those so I'm happy with the garrisons, and if it didn't provide the current benefits then it would just be another thing you can do besides having to do the daily quests and farming.

I guess for players who wish to do nothing but raid or pvp just simply clicking a few work order cooldowns every few hours is a dream come true, but for those players whose main playtime revolved around alting, professions and gathering/farming etc, a whole avenue of gameplay has just been as good as removed. 
<br /> 
<br />I don't hate the garrison, I can see the appeal, things like the Glad Sanctum and Stables, upgrades etc are actually quite fun, I just upgraded some of my stuff today and have enjoyed it! But for anyone remotely interested in spending time on professions, it's not really much fun at all to have nothing to do but wait to click cooldown buttons on work orders and have pretty much everything gated behind that.","2014-12-03 18:10:00"

 <br />I don't really understand the 'it's mandatory' thing. What exactly do you really need to do with garrisons to PVP or raid or whatever? 
 <br /> 
 <br />You might say it really cripples your professions but it takes 5 mins a day to mine/herb and set some work orders going. Do you really hate it so much you can't spend 5 mins there?

Garrisons have been made far too integral a part of WoD, to the extent that they've overshadowed everything else, and I feel really bad for the people who aren't fond of them. 
<br /> 
<br />From the start Garrisons should have more closely resembled the player housing feature they were billed as; more about cosmetic customisation and a few cool optional activities to enjoy, rather than an integral nexus for character progression. 
<br /> 
<br />Garrisons are a really cool part of the game, and an addition that I like a lot. Their massive impact on gameplay, however, isn't.

<br /> 
<br />5 months ago I passed some exams and wanted to see my old char.I bought MoP and went through it in 1 month.I thought it was awesome (not realizing that I blazed through content in 1 month and people are stuck with it for 2 years).I paused again because of the exams and started playing 2 months ago.I finished everything in WoW in the month before WoD (Loremaster, many rep etc) and I was so hyped to play though an expansion fully like WotLK.

<br />I pre ordered WoD, I got the Dread Raven too and even race changed my boosted guy since I hated the race I picked.And then it comes.

<br />2 weeks realizing all you posted, how this is just a scam to keep you playing.I wanted to quit a couple of times but each day my little farm changed my mind because of &quot;all the rewards&quot;.

<br /> 
<br />You are very correct on this point. During early WoW we didn't have any queues to sit and wait in because there was no LFD feature. 
<br /> 
<br />HOWEVER if it was one thing we did during Wrath and BC it was standing around in Dalaran or Shattrath, waiting for invites from people spamming /trade. 
<br /> 
<br />YES WE WERE STANDING AROUND WAITING EVEN IN 2008! 
<br /> 
<br />Again! This is what happens when you make your whole game revolve around endgame instead of the journey. 
<br /> 
<br />World of Warcraft in modern day have a definitive end which is when you are done with levelling. The issue is that there is nothing in place to solve this in PvE outside of raids. When you are locked out of your weekly's then you are done playing for that week. 
<br /> 
<br />World of Warcraft is a great game that's not what I'm saying here. Even after 10 years i'd consider it my third best MMORPG of all time and I like others have enjoyed levelling numerous of characters to max level. 
<br /> 
<br />However the issue still stands; Blizzard have just no way to keep peoples interest at max level and especially after how burnt out people was during the Endless Siege of Orgrimmar you'd thought they had systems in place in Warlords of Draenor to combat this and keep ppls interest (subs) throughout the timespan of the expac. 
<br /> 
<br />Unfortunately looking at Warlords of Draenors current state it looks like Blizzard already have hit that brick wall that they ran into during Pandaria. 
<br />The worst is that we are in the start of the new expac but gameplay wise we are already back to where we left off during the Endless Siege of Orgrimmar; burnt out, bored and unwilling to keep on paying our subs because there is nothing to do. 
<br /> 
<br />For us it's a good thing cause we are saving money. For Blizzard it's a disaster because they lose countless of money from their poor design choices.","2014-12-04 08:04:00"

    You can skip it if you want, just buy the crafted stuff on the AH instead. 
    That's the alternative. The gear won't be an issue in a few weeks when 
    people have a few raid drops, HC raiding gear is better than double 
    upgraded profession stuff anyway. Enchant/gem prices will come down soon 
    as well and then you can just buy them from the AH if you really hate the 
    garrison so much.<br><br>Or you can do the absolute minimum to aid your 
    professions by simply spending 5 mins a day there getting the ore and 
    herbs and setting work orders going. Once a day you go there for literally 
    5 mins and that is enough to get the bonus stuff for your professions. 
    Again, a lot of the profession stuff will be a lot cheaper in the coming 
    weeks anyway or in the case of the gear completely pointless once you have 
    some pieces from raids.

<br />But yes - when you said it removes something from people who used to spend most of their playtime farming - yes, it does. The need or desire to spend anywhere near as much time online, for a start. Fairly sure less time online is not what Blizzard wants from paying subscribers.

<br />What I meant was, there are people (like me) who were

      WoW more than ever, has turned into a lobby game for me. I sit in my 
      garrison waiting for queues to pop. Every now and then I get the ding 
      that tells me its time to send the followers back out. I do not enjoy 
      garrisons. I do them because I feel I need to to keep pace with my 
      professions.<br><br>Garrisons are Farmville, there is no escaping that. 
      I detest Farmville.<br><br>I started in Wrath. I have never felt this 
      bored so early into an expansion. I'm meant to start raiding with my 
      guild next week (peeps off this week so couldn't start) and you know, 
      I'm really not sure If I can be bothered.<br><br>

<br />I don't like that every path in the game goes through the Garrison. It's unavoidable since it's a boost to literally every activity in the game. If you enjoy that activity, you need a garrison.","2014-12-04 23:35:00"

<br /> 
<br />&quot;Yes, I can travel on a ground mount, I can gather materials, and explore, but, if there are flying mounts in the game I HAVE to use them to be competitive !! Therefore, Ground mounts are not an option !!&quot; 
<br /> 
<br />Its the exact same argument, just with different subject matter. 
<br /> 
<br />There is nothing that I can see (after some of the breadcrumb quests for leveling) that is locked out by not using the Garrison (obviously discounting Garrison Specific features like followers etc.). 
<br /> 
<br />The gear that garrison missions can provide can also be obtained from the Raids, it just takes longer without the garrison. 
<br />The Profession materials can be obtained without the Garrison, it just takes longer without it. 
<br />The Garrison invasions can drop items and mounts, but all of those can be obtained out in the world too. It just takes longer without the garrison.

    My main problem with the garrisons came with the mission rewards. Never 
    before has an aspect in this game has an as appalling effect on me as 
    garrisons had once I realized that. Not only do I have to log on to set 
    the missions as often as possible, but it is an aspect of the game that 
    really doesn't interest me.<br><br>To put it into perspective, a co-raider 
    in my raid team reached 680 ilvl when I had 671 just solely because of 
    garrisons. 4 mythic rewards, including a trinket from the end boss which 
    we haven't even killed. Utterly disgraceful.<br><br>

      &quot;Yes, I can travel on a ground mount, I can gather materials, and

    Except there is nobody who's gonna stop you and say: &quot;you're moving X% 
    slower than the other mounted people. Since you have put in so little

Just they be running around in the city instead. 
<br /> 
<br />Raiders have always (or at least before it was a game filled with whiny children) been farming something for 5 hours a day, just to raid 2 nights a week. 
<br />Garrisons just reduce the amount of time you are farming. Making bots less needed. 
<br />There were so much farming requirement time, that people felt the need to use a bot, because they didn't have time to play that many hours a day, that this game required. 
<br /> 
<br />Then there was daily quests to make us even more sticky to the game every day. 
<br />That changed to weekly quests, and you could do them more times a day. so now you could log in 1 or 2 days a week instead of every day, and still keep up. But this disappeared again. 
<br /> 
<br />Garrisons work orders is kinda similar. You can log in every 3. day or so, instead of daily. You will miss out on some resources, but then you can just have a farm character, like in the old days and still get more materials now, than you ever could before( without a bot) 
<br /> 
<br />One said that his m8 got ilvl 680 because of garrison missions. Well that is not because of the high ilvl gear, but because his low ilvl gear got switched. You can in fact still get the same gear from other places, if you are a raider. just give it a few more weeks, just like in the old days. oh w8, back then you could go for a year, and still not get your items, while some of your fellow raiders got them all in 2 months or so. 
<br /> 
<br />What has changed with garrisons. Casual and solo players can still get gear. 
<br />Your spend less time farming (in this otherwise farmville game) 
<br />bots are less likely to occur. 
<br />you have to go to another place than your main working location to be social(oh w8, we always did that), or you have to be in a party/raid. 
<br /> 
<br />daily quests are still here, just as before garrisons. Not sure if they are important. 
<br /> 
<br />I would like to be able to open ones garrison to friends and guild members. without being in a party or even being logged in. 
<br /> 
<br />Professions: 
<br />Stop whining, you are not really playing the garrison game, if you just head down to your profession buildings and right click the crates and them click on a person there, ask him the do 21 more f those, then leave. 
<br />voila you now have speed up your professions material production. 
<br /> 
<br />So yes there could be done more for the garrisons, but take it slow and see what happens, is a good thing. maybe some of our ideas for garrisons and alternatives, will be implemented later, when this is more stable. 
<br />Maybe they make guild garrisons and maybe they will be unstable / unbalanced. and maybe still will have too much work required or maybe they will have too little for us to do. 
<br />Maybe it depends on how many is in the guild and how many hours they have each. 
<br /> 
<br />Maybe it is hard to target both players who play 12 hours a day and players who plays 8 hours a week.","2015-02-05 11:56:00"

<br /> 
<br />There are ways to indirectly mention sexuality without just randomly blurting it out. As in the example I gave, a quest-giver could tell you to go save his partner who's been taken by saberon. Upon saving them, you realise the partner is infact of the same gender as the quest-giver. 
<br />

<br /> 
<br />first of all we are not in north korea and since these are the european boards i would invite you to speak openly and save the doubts for topics regarding mafia and other illegal activities which definitely don't fit a videogame's message board.

<br />the real controversial thing here is the fact that !@#$-sexuality at the end of 2014 is considered &quot;not to be discussed on the forums&quot; and that some user like you may feel uncomfortable enough to decide to withdraw their previous post. 
<br /> 
<br />videogames as massive as wow could totally move the decency forward but i guess there's too much to lose in saying &quot;f-- you ________ (insert name of homophobic country's government here)&quot; because companies are not humanitarian associations after all and it's not up to them to raise the tolerance bar higher and/or giving lessons to people. 
<br /> 
<br />the funny thing is... videogames as massive as wow are totally capable to influence the pop culture (some already did) and we all know that a pop phenomena reaches many more people than some humanitarian plead. 
<br /> 
<br />if wow ever became controversial because of gay characters... how stupid would that be? the main plot in this game is taking part in a war and slaughter the enemies and despising them also because they belong to another race. i see PLENTY of horrible things that this game potentially is teaching to the younger generations (be the strongest, kill your enemies, never trust a member of another race) but the reason why this game is doing great (beyond the technical features like pvp, raids and dungeons) is the fact that the plot has been wonderfully written and many characters show true emotional depth and weaknesses and in some case they do teach lessons of humanity, plus the company itself respects any kind of differences when it comes to its employees so i am sure, and i wait, that a moment will come when they introduce gay characters, maybe silently, maybe without any announcement and that'd be the greatest victory because if something is normal doesn't have to be greatly shown off... or maybe they even did already and we didn't even notice.

<br />Amazing post! This reminds me of the story of that high school friend with high intellect mentioned earlier. You guys have something special to explain yourselves. N you're able to say or write all the right words to explain things perfectly in a very emotionaly balanced way! It's something many others aren't able to do! Talent for writing N speaking with perfectly balanced emotions and reasoning! Lovely post! 
<br /> 
<br />You balance between talking intellectualy and talking comprehensibly perfectly. For a lady, most of the times when a man talks to you, it's either incomprehensibly advanced, or either like a farmer or sexualy oriented. One of three opposites. This is usualy not so with gay men. It's why gay people always have a lot female friends! :o)","2014-11-25 04:11:00"

      representation can be subtle and visibile at the same time.<br><br>If 
      Blizzard want to use romance as a catalyst to character development I 
      see no reason not to include gays and lesbians simply due to the fact 
      that ho-mo-sexuality is common in the human species. But they won't 
      because if they tried, the trolls would wind up a !@#$ storm. <strong>And 
      I'd rather just be able to play the game in peace, than to listen to 
      their crap!</strong>

    This, I wasnt 100% aware of these type of storyline sin wow... kinda 
    rushed through content ^^<br><br>Anyways , I dont take back what I said, 
    but maybe there is a place for it it WoW and Warcraft, maybe sexuality has 
    been in WoW and they have just done it very well.<br><br>Go for it, and 
    too be honest if a Openly Gay character get countries like Russia and a 
    few African countries to withdraw their support etc, well then stuff, who 
    needs them.<br><br>I have gay friends, and before a friend of mine came 
    out, I had gone out a few times for drinks and even a movie or two, he 
    came out and I carried on doing what I did before.<br><br>In terms of 
    religion though, people need to get a life..... Im Christian, but I do not 
    say muslims are the devil, or gay my die or what ever, that God duty to 
    condemn or Judge if he see fit to do so... Not mine a a creation of God, 
    but Religious people alway make some story up, anyone seen that Moster 
    Energy drinks area product of the devil??<br><br>Anyways, back on topic 
    sorry.... Go for it Blizz, you have my support, if its done tastefully and 
    within the story of WoW and character development then 100% supported

 </div>I'll probably get shot down for this - but I was wondering why WoW has no gay characters? Gays play the game too, and it's the 21st Century and all. 
 <br /> 
 <br />A lot of young people play the game, and it'd make a good impression, and help people be more accepting in everyday life. 
 <br /> 
 <br />Yes, I'm gay, and don't really care about the homophobes, but think WoW would be doing themselves a service if they implemented a character into the game which is gay.

<br />Let's say they do it, how do we know he's gay? Will he be, like, 24/7 in action? And with whom? I suppose one gay is not enough, there should be at least two. May be there should be also an annual gay parade in Stormwind.","2014-11-25 10:02:00"

<br />Running around with their bulging sweaty muscles, in skimpy outfits, competing with each other who is the &quot;baddest&quot; and who have the greatest chin. . 
<br /> 
<br />The violence thus becomes the &quot;middle ground&quot; which naturalises the homoeroticism between the object (the characters) and the adoring viewers eye. Soon the physical attraction the main lore characters share for each other which is neutralized by the violence become obvious. 
<br /> 
<br />We love it because of the same reason we watched movies starring Arnold, Stallone, Dolph etcetera when we were kids; there is something special with a big hunky man beating up numerous bad guys with his bare hands. 
<br />That something special touches a young boys heart in a very special way whatever your preferred gender attraction is. 
<br /> 
<br />This whole expansion is an 80s B-action homoerotic movie and that's why I love it so much. I look forward to watching Grommash, Blackhand and the crew be &quot;manly&quot; and sexual.

Talent for writing N speaking with perfectly balanced emotions and reasoning! Lovely post! 
 <br /> 
 <br />You balance between talking intellectualy and talking comprehensibly perfectly. For a lady, most of the times when a man talks to you, it's either incomprehensibly advanced, or either like a farmer or sexualy oriented. One of three opposites. This is usualy not so with gay men. It's why gay people always have a lot female friends! :o)

</blockquote> 
<br /> 
<br />Maybe because being gay 
<em>is</em> mainstream? 
<br /> 
<br />Gay people can not only openly have relationships, but can get married in many places, including parts of the US and in the UK. 
<br /> 
<br />So, unless you make some sort of backstory that being openly gay is disallowed in the society in question, surely it's unrepresentative to not show it (at least subtly)? 
<br /> 
<br />In historical games, which are based on reality, you could argue that it was frowned upon back then, to be openly gay; so, to show it in any kind of open way would be inaccurate. 
<br /> 
<br />But in games which portray the present (in the West, anyway), the future, or some kind of alternate universe, to not show it and to not explain why you're not showing it, basically equals a glaring omission. 
<br /> 
<br />People, in the future, will probably talk about the time when gay relationships were not portrayed in games, despite them being widely accepted IRL at the time.","2014-11-25 11:40:00"

<br /> 
<br />Well, in a way I agree with you. 
<br /> 
<br />Who cares which gender it turns out someone prefers? 
<br /> 
<br />Especially if they're not in a serious relationship, at the time. 
<br /> 
<br />There is absolutely no need to announce that a single person is gay, for example. 
<br /> 
<br />However, the problem is that we see straight serious relationships (marriages etc.) openly referenced, all the time, in games. 
<br /> 
<br />If serious romantic relationships (gay, or straight) were never openly referenced, you might have a point. 
<br /> 
<br />But, as they are, the danger is that it makes it look like, either the writer is intentionally hiding gay relationships, or the chars are being portrayed as hiding their own gay relationships, due to them being ashamed, or scared, or whatever.

    apart from the obvious trolls, im afraid i have to disagree....its not 
    toxic in the slightest....i sincerely HOPE it doesnt get locked down, as 
    weve never had a thread go on for so long discussing it - that in itself 
    shows how society and the player base have moved from only a year or two 
    ago......there will always be people with differing views, but the point 
    of discussion is to address each persons views....not slate them as 
    garbage etc.<br><br>if you disagree with him, then say so...explain why 
    (as you did) but then adding the quote into what you wrote makes you 
    become part of the problem.......

<br />Indeed, this sort of thing when discussed seriously isn't toxic. But everyone is posting massive amounts of crap about how it's effecting/ effected them in an aggressive manner which is provoking people. I'm saying the way this was constructed as garbage. I do disagree with the OP and I've given my point in it before. Being gay doesn't make you special; though it doesn't make you less of a human being. It makes you the same as everyone else. Unless being oppressed, why does it deserve more recognition then other things? Please, explain to me. I'm against people being oppressed for their sexuality, yes. but not for recognition for their sexuality as if it's something special. Because that is what is toxic. Everyone is human, Race, gander, sexuality, what ever.

<br />How does quoting add me to the problem? It's showing what I'm talking about= otherwise it would just be a cluster of random things being said and it would be difficult to follow. How is that better? Enlighten me please.","2014-11-25 12:40:00"

<br />I hope no one believes that a child, who sees a committed gay relationship represented in a game, would be more inclined to become gay?

<br />Sexuality is set in the womb or, at the latest, in early childhood (in the case of boys). 
<br /> 
<br />By the time a child is 12, it is pretty much set in stone, from what I understand (and has been for some time). 
<br /> 
<br />Maybe the finer nuances may still be influenced, but the basics, like orientation, are already set.

<br />The conservatism is even more interesting, given that, if anyone even dares to mention, on here, that seeing violence in games 
<em>may</em> possibly encourage IRL violence, for some people, they get shot down in flames.

      Putting in a few gay characters who aren't stereo-types, male orcs 
      rather than belfs for example, is not going to detract from the game if 
      it's done tastefully. I'd welcome it.

      What I have a problem with is the 'need' to give it awareness. Once of 
      the best players and one of my best friends I ever made on here was gay. 
      ( Dax represent! ) But it's something he said to me a while ago about 
      why, he was against guilds with a gay community;This is a game. You're 
      meant to be immersed into a fictional world where you are judged by 
      nothing but your ability to play and your attitude towards effort and 
      ability of both yourself and other players

 <br /> 
 <br />my daughter *knew* she was gay before the age of 16...she had feelings towards other females that went beyond friendship, so she talked to me and her mother about her feelings......sex never came into it....if it had, i would probably have been as Intolerant as the next parent talking with their child about under-aged sex :D 
 <br /> 
 <br />i guess the point is - just because your child is under a certain age - doesnt mean they should be sheltered from everything....people walk down the street every day, you wouldnt cover their eyes if a man/woman couple walked by holding hands....similarly you wouldnt if two men/women did....... 
 <br /> 
 <br />thats how i feel about it being in a game......it shouldnt be openly promoted, nor should it be hidden.....as i said earlier, you portray them as you would everyone else, because they ARE like everyone else

</blockquote> 
<br /> 
<br />That's good parenting being able to talk, In a calm reflected manor, With your child, Being able to offer advise and support. More so if it is against your beliefs. SEX in this house is discussed but on their level, and only when they fetch the subject up, living in a rural country village the district nurse is a god send. 
<br />More so with the past history.(Also helped as a councillor at the time) 
<br /> 
<br /> Females do develop quicker in the mind and sexually. Some blokes never grow up I am sorry to say. 
<br /> 
<br />True we shouldn't shelter a child but we also shouldn't show them all the world has to offer, We need to let them discover that for themselves not all at that age have the ability to fully get a grasp on what their seeing, on the streets as you rightfully mentioned. 
<br /> 
<br />Should we ban it hell no, It would drive us back to the stone age, But I will stick to my guns !@#$%^-*!@ity has no place in a 12 rated game, Even if they already know about it, We don't have the power to alter the laws of the land without the vote.

<br /> 
<br />Okay, there is more than I've noticed but it's not because I'm conditioned to think it's normal. In fact, that's a little bit too far to say that in my opinion. I understand and realise that how people feel about others is just that. It's how they feel. I wouldn't say it's normal, I wouldn't say it's abnormal either. The reason it's abused is because it's campaigned for being seen as normal which I believe is wrong; normal defines something unnatural about things. Being human is normal, it shouldn't go any further than that. Everyone is built up of the same things so why should anything else matter. 
<br /> 
<br />But saying about having children is making straight recognized isn't correct. That's reproduction; if that wasn't to be then Garrosh, Thrall, Heck. Anduin, saurfang.... Etc would ruin the game if they were not there. Since they play a massive role and reproduction adds to the lore. Their sexuality isn't thrown into it. Differentiation is key here. Unless you're conditioned to look for things that do not exist.","2014-11-25 13:50:00"

<br />I understand that it would probably to good for people who are gay to feel more accepted. But this is a game. Doing so in the real world would make a whole lot of difference I agree, and it would do good. But in a fictional universe would probably do more worse than good. 
<br /> 
<br />Being victimized by society in the real world; goes to the fictional world because they're accepted (Indeed it is right that they are accepted since they are human) but surely that would only make them (If you're looking at it this way) feel more trapped? 
<br /> 
<br />Ever since I've played (TBC- Not bragging just to give an idea of what I mean by what I say next) I have found probably the most enlightening, accepting, nicest community being gamers. Since the player base is so diverse in origin and who the people are; It's extremely nice to know I am a part of it. While I don't believe in casting aside things like this, in contrast with the real world I don't see how it will do any good.","2014-11-25 14:09:00"

<br />The OP is indeed correct. There should be a few gay characters. The main reason there isn't is that Blizzard as a business can't risk it. Too many parents would force their children to unsubscribe. Then they'll probably go buy them some 18's rated shooting game. :/ 
<br />Parents are probably the worst offenders on this topic, seeing people treated equally wont turn your children gay (as if that was even an issue), it just means they'll learn to treat everyone equally too.

<br /> 
<br />I mean your main reason to your suggestion is because you want h&ouml;mosxuals to be more accepted in the society, which has nothing to do with the game. World of Warcraft is a fantasy game about war, it isn't a human rights organisation to get rid of all sort of discrimination that has been going on for centuries in the real life. 
<br /> 
<br />I don't want too much political correctness in a story called Warcraft nor a game called World of Warcraft. You can't please everyone and make &quot;all sort of people&quot; with different backgrounds feel home. 
<br /> 
<br />I was actually thinking of it earlier today before I read this topic, what if everyone wanted Blizzard to make every person's character adapted to how we are in the real life. Like if people complained that the human race should also have more Asian like faces. And that some people maybe wants a wheelchair because they've never been able to walk and so on. 
<br /> 
<br />I think everyone should forget about the real life when it comes to give suggestions about World of Warcraft and try to just focus on the fantasy world. :)

<br />People never get angry on you or fight you when you walk with boyfriend being gay, people are bothered when gays are PUBLICLY telling and walking with rainbows on streets , WE ARE GAY , WE ARE GAY!! ... this is what people hate. 
<br /> 
<br />Just shut the hell up and be what you are and live normaly like some do, you don't have to do it in public and scream look at me Im gay. This is example also this forum thread. 
<br /> 
<br />You want a gay character, and you wanna let know everybody that you are gay and how you don't care about someone other &quot;quoting you: homophobes in this case&quot; . This is the problem, as long as gay people walk and do their normal thing like other nobody will care, but ofc if you walk in public with &quot;movement of gay people&quot; that has papers and rainbows showing &quot;im gay we want more rights&quot; its normal that you gonna get beaten up. 
<br /> 
<br />In this case u got beaten up via forum and online... and what is for you &quot; gay character &quot; gay normal look as same just as casual people do, or are you special kind with perfect looks ? Define me gay looking character.","2014-11-25 14:37:00"

<br /> 
<br />First of all I must say I agree with the notion that in order to be treated equally you must begin by treating yourself equally as well, not expecting any kind of special treatment just because of your choice of sexuality. Thus why I also agree this game doesn&acute;t need a gay character just for the sake of being gay. 
<br /> 
<br />With that out of the way I must say I wish what you said was true. Never in my life did anyone discover I was gay until I had a boyfriend. I live just like anyone else and dress just like anyone else. This should be stupid to say, but you never know... 
<br />Now I can&acute;t say I&acute;m abused or look at with bad eyes, but there are times when I go out with my husband and youngsters and children call us censored things. You think it&acute;s because we are declaring we are gay or kissing or making out in public? No: we just hold hands at most, or sometimes not even that; since they know us they insult us just because we have different sexual tastes than them. Yes, I&acute;m not only talking about anonymous people, I&acute;m also talking about my neighbours, none of which are above 20. Doesn&acute;t speak well for the future generations. 
<br />And I&acute;m talking about Spain, a country where gay marriage is legalized. I can&acute;t imagine how bad it must be in places like Russia. In a world like this I can understand how some people want to fight for their right to have a normal life. A life where you can walk on the street without the fear of being called things or worse just because you have a different sexual taste than other people.

11817,226,"562c117a2b3c5d35","! I personally think that it is impossible in a way to add gay NPC''s into the game without making it some caricature of gays or without it &quot;shoving it into the players face&quot;, with this I mean saying stuff like &quot;I'm gay!&quot; or some horrendous romantic scene (I find any romantic scene wheter it be straight, gay or whatever horrendous). 
<br /> 
<br />Besides, I find topics like this a VERY, VERY hard topic to discuss as is with most social issues. On one side, I can sympathise with you since you want a character to relate to on the other side I can feel that people dont want to have it in the game (be it religious motives, personal preference) and they have the right to think that. 
<br /> 
<br />Personally, I think this shouldnt be added in the game or a main focus in the game industry. The reason why is because it becomes a mandatory thing game developers have to implement and it will just end up as the &quot;that one coloured person we put in so the minority of whatever group we inteded to aim X medium at doesnt feel left out&quot; which defeats the whole purpose. 
<br /> 
<br />Like I said social issues like these are hard topics and can cause a massive sh*tstorm, even now im struggeling to make my point come across clear enough and I already have a light headache. 
<br /> 
<br />In the end we all just want to play a game and we dont care if a character is gay,straight black, blue, purple, mutated or whatever. 
<br /> 
<br />Let games be games, just like how movies are movies or songs are songs. Social issues dont belong in games and should be left to be discussed in real everday society.

 </div>You have an anime named 'Akame Ga Kill!' with a character in it named Bulat. 
 <br />He was a really awesome guy and turned out to be gay as one of the members told a new member (the lead character), they did him real well as there was nothing cliche, stupid or flamboyant about him and he was just one of the leading fighters who happened to be a pretty awesome one too. 
 <br />That is how I like it done, no weird joke type of personality, just one of the guys who happens to be gay, simple. 
</blockquote> 
<br />Exactly. 
<br /> 
<br />The best way to do such a thing in a WoW context would be to have a bit of a love-story questchain where one character asks you to help find if the guy is into her. And when you get around to asking the guy he would casually go &quot;Ah, yeah, sorry no, I don't swing that way.&quot; 
<br /> 
<br />Point is, though, why would there be such a quest in this game? For what reason? 
<br /> 
<br />If it's just for the sake of showing gayness is okay it becomes little more than a contrived political statement, and not something natural. 
<br /> 
<br />It's a peculiar dilemma: Asking why a character 'should be gay' is the same as asking why his hair should be black: No reason, it's just a random choice the designer makes. 
<br /> 
<br />But it has no relevance at all, it isn't a big deal to emphasize because it ISN'T a big deal to begin with. 
<br /> 
<br />I maintain that it would have been cool if they had done the same with Thrall, at one point or whatever have it be known that he was actually gay.

Trying to explain someone's sexuality to a 12 year old is the same as asking them to understand political issues. 
<br /> 
<br />I'm also wondering why you make such an issue out of the sexuality of pixelated NPC's in a game where storylines have nothing to do with who's engaging in coitus with who. Yes, there's procreation, and the game focuses on characters like sons and daugthers whose legacy is defined by their parents sometimes. That's normal for an MMO.

When I play WoW I don't sit there thinking to myself &quot;Oh, this character is clearly !@#$%^-*!@#$/gay/bi-sexual!&quot;. I'm wondering if you would also consider the game to be racist due to the fact that there clearly isn't any Finnish, German, Mexican NPC's. I mean come on, where does it end? o.O 
<br /> 
<br />My advice, play the game the way YOU want to, believe what you want, see the NPC's how you'd like, and just have fun. Don't spend so much time worrying about whether or not NPC 01 is engaged in a %^-*!@#$%^ relationship with NPC 02.

<br />My point rather being, I find it odd that people are more concerned about the depiction of gays in a game than the depiction of violence in it, considering the latter is obviously more abhorrent. 
<br /> 
<br />That said I do agree I see no point in depicting such characters when it is not particularly relevant, but that's a bit of paradox. As said, a character's sexual orientation is just about the same as their haircolour or skincolour: It's one random trait that may not have any particular significance or influence on the story or their development at all, and when used for the sake of making it a topic to raise awareness, it just becomes contrived.. 
<br />

 <br /> 
 <br />My point rather being, I find it odd that people are more concerned about the depiction of gays in a game than the depiction of violence in it, considering the latter is obviously more abhorrent. 
 <br /> 
 <br />That said I do agree I see no point in depicting such characters when it is not particularly relevant, but that's a bit of paradox. As said, a character's sexual orientation is just about the same as their haircolour or skincolour: It's one random trait that may not have any particular significance or influence on the story or their development at all, and when used for the sake of making it a topic to raise awareness, it just becomes contrived.. 
 <br /> 
 <br />As for the second part of your message, I would argue there's a strong difference between &quot;Not mentioning it because it is not relevant to mention&quot; and &quot;not mentioning it out of fear of ridicule and abuse&quot;, the latter being what your post was advocating if I read it right. Hence my disagreement with it. 
 <br /> 
 <br />That said I agree that someone randomly stating &quot;hey guys, I'm gay&quot; is about as stupid and pointless as someone saying &quot;hey guys I'm straight&quot;.

<br /> 
<br />Well I think the title of the game is a real give away to most, &quot;WARCRAFT&quot; violence and killing, But that said: (actually said to lighten things up) 
<br /> 
<br />I have been able to teach mine to hurt others is unacceptable, And that sometimes not everyone is as nice as them. And at times their not as nice as some people would like them to be, it is part of life. it has helped to separate fact from fiction. 
<br /> 
<br />It has helped greatly with forming opinions theory and planning. Along side other basic skills like maths and English, Even some art lessons in there, Little lad loves dragons and has a thing for Onyxia. 
<br /> 
<br />The problem we have with violence Turn any news channel on and what do you see and hear about ?

<br />Pain, suffering and death with and without the violence, Why it sells news and the more they beef it up the higher the ratings.

<br />It's not a big ask really. Throwing in a few more speaking npcs that are the same gender and married/dating (perhaps quest givers) really isn't as huge, crazy, or different from many hetrosexual npcs. People aren't asking for kissy-kissy scenes or anything like that at all, just the slight nod in recognition that they can exist in what we imagine as our fantasy world. We can imagine a boy and girl being together in warcraft- really, why not anything else? Why is this considered so game-breaking? 
<br /> 
<br />It's not something 12 year-olds can't see either- it's not explicit, it's just two darn npcs with the same last name, that are the same gender! There are a growing number of children with parents that are the same gender, and they seem to manage just fine without being scarred deeply by the knowledge.

</blockquote> 
<br /> 
<br />To tell the truth I also think those marches are over the top and represent the worst gay stereotypes most conservative people have, which is far from a good idea. The original idea behind them, though, was to show the world gay people are no different and deserve to be treated just like any ordinary person, since they are ordinary persons after all. What you do in your private life should be of no one&acute;s concern. 
<br /> 
<br />On this thread you can see a couple of these examples, and I&acute;m not sure all of them are trolls: people that force their values on you and judge you as a person based on something that doesn&acute;t affect their lives at all, calling you things and feeling superior just because you love someone from the same sex as you. 
<br /> 
<br />So I find it perfectly OK that people manifest themselves and rise up to demand to be treated equally and without judgement from conservative people. But as I said, doing it by showing themselves as special and different they are undermining their claims. Your sexual orientation shouldn&acute;t make you worse or better than anyone.","2014-11-26 10:04:00"

</blockquote> 
<br /> 
<br />It runs a little deeper than that, though. Gay Pride is also standing in defiance against festivals that, in the past, catered exclusively to straight couples. For example, any fare you go to, you will see stalls about romance, etc. But those are (were, in progressive countries) catering exclusively to straight couple, and gays would be frowned upon, or downright shown the door. 
<br /> 
<br />Not saying I endorse the overt flamboyance of Pride, but I do understand, and support the idea behind it.

<br /> 
<br />i agree on both counts.....it IS more media grabbing, but it always will be at first...they feel they need to catch the public eye and make them aware of discrimination that still happens (not just gay people by the way) 
<br />ONCE things change, then of course, people will drop into the back ground.....but it needs to be forefront to make people sit up. 
<br /> 
<br />i personally dont like any kind of protest march....i feel people should protest in other ways...if a government isnt liked...vote them out, dont protest about them.....if a rule or law is unjust, campaign to have it changed using politicians and public support, but dont have a march about it etc etc 
<br /> 
<br />but anyway - back on topic firmly.....the op is falling under the above *trap* - he has to be out there and making his point of view known - so he can get the sameness he wants.....and like ive said earlier, theres nothing wrong in having gay/bi or whatever sexuality in game, as long as its as subtle, but pervasive as heter0 relationships are represented.....and they ARE everywhere in game.","2014-11-26 10:57:00"

  <br />If it's done tastefully, then I see no issue. 
 </blockquote>Even though I could understand what you're saying, there's not that much diversity in the wow human race as it is either. Do you see other skin colors than just different shades of white? Do you see anything but churches and chapels? I say we need mosques and synagogues in wow! 
 <br /> 
 <br />How do you know there are no gay wow characters currently? I've never seen a marriage licence or characters of the opposing sex making out? I'd think it would be quite discriminating if they would make characters stereotypical gays. How would a tasteful gay be characterized? 
 <br /> 
 <br />On a more trolly note, I think you're discriminating for saying none of the wow characters are gay. You truly hurt young Anduin's heart. 
</blockquote> 
<br /> 
<br />The wow universe is kinda set up like this: 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<em>Humans</em> are the default white western male or maybe lets say, priviliged white male american christian republian in the states (or how some percieve this stereotypical default setting to be). Im not going to deep into this, just saying how it is stereotypically portrayed. 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<em>Dwarves</em> are the Scottish, irish culture, still christians. 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<em>Gnomes</em> they are just weird. 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<em>Night elves</em> They are kind of like either japanese or turks, so either they represent the japanese culture and religion or muslim faith, culture, not sure. Im thinking its more Japanese though. 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<em>Blood elves</em> Seems alot like they are based off persian culture or something of the sort, so it would be the culture and religion of that . 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<em>Pandaren</em> are obviously based off chinese culture and buddhism. 
<br /> 
<br />Ok ill stop there but my point is that most cultures and religions are already represented in the game. Adressing the part you spoke about &quot;I say we need mosques and synagogues in wow!&quot;

<br /> 
<br />Dumbledore being gay? It added nothing to his character. Rowling just added it because accepting gay was the cool thing to do. 
<br /> 
<br />Sure blizzard could add a gay character, but it would have to actually mean something, influence the character, change them.

<br />I don't feel like Blizzard is doing an injustice by not including %^-*!@#$%^ity either.

<br />I get what you are saying. But look here is the way I see it. This game was made more than 10 years ago, things have changed since then. Like someone listed a bit back in the thread, there are whole lot of games today where they have put this in, just to make a stand. Being all neutral works if you don't want to offend the.. who? Yeah, I think you know who would be &quot;offended&quot; if wow actively took the fight and put in some happy characters. Should we care about those kind of people and what they are offended about and pander to them? I mean if you really have nothing against happy people why care or be offended if Blizzard decides to support through the game. 
<br /> 
<br />There is a fight for the rights of happy people, even today. Just look at some of the laws in russia and other countrys for example. You can just sit back and be neutral or take up the shield, armour and string the bow, bring forth that mighty battle axe and take up the fight.","2014-11-27 09:28:00"

<br />Because some people will might be think the gayness can influence their child. Wich is not true at all. I saw that manytimes in tv, in real, read about it, ect... And they fear this can be modify their sexual orrientacion out of shape, wich is both not true, if you all read the article what that sexy orc linked in the forum above us. It tells much about the sexual orientacion. But what it doesn't mention, is the people fear, or call it what ever you want. Wich is actualy sometimes makes it quiet hard to them to face this. And ofc we al have to agree the computer games could be atracting the childs behiviors as well. You probably heard, or read about many articles about: This child, or guy died when they palyed wow. Now think of it how could it be seen such an article like this looking: A 12 years old Child became gay while played wow. Wich is doesn't makes any sense at all, cos if you have read that article in that wikipedia link above us, you can understand the whole whole sexuality. And that makes it clear it isn't connected with the game. It is based on the people point of view, and their opend mind. For those who can accsept the different sexual orientation, they don't care about this, and they both dosen't see any problem about this. But notice this is not meaning evrie body hase the same point of view in this topic. In my opion, This is surly not gonna harm anybody if it stays in the line.","2014-11-27 09:44:00"

    1% on average isn't true. Do your research. The numbers are higher even in 
    recent censuses.<br><br>First of all the 10% was conceived by Kinsey 
    during his research on sexual behaviour in american men and women. However 
    later research has show that the number vary from area to area and from 
    country to country.<br><br>While it is true that some censuses have 
    conceived the number around as low as 0,8% those numbers have been 
    calculated in certain countries and areas where people do not perceive 
    !@#$%^-*!@ity as normal. If you look at the american census there were 
    apparantly a lot more gays and lesbians on the east and west coast in the 
    US, who tend to be more liberal towards LGBT people.<br><br>This means 
    that these kinds of censuses have a margin of error that is locally and 
    culturally dictated. Some people are either in denial or won't tell anyone 
    about it at all.<br><br>These numbers have the methodical errors of first 
    of all relying on the participants replying in honesty. This is shown in 
    the numbers of mostly young people tend to admit that they were gay or 
    lesbian, while elder people apparantly weren't gay at all.<br><br>Secondly 
    they don't take yearly development into account. As in how would things 
    look if you asked the same people a few years after. It is not uncommon 
    for gay people to wait ages to come out of the closet.<br><br>From a 
    cultural perspective this makes sense, as younger generations has been 
    more open and inclined to openly identiy as gay, lesbian or bi due to 
    progress made in the area. However these censuses does not take into 
    account:<br><br>1. People who outright lied in the census.<br>2. Closeted 
    gay or lesbians<br>3. Lack of knowledge as to what it means to be gay or 
    lesbian (aka. the recipient don't understand what is being asked. Almost 
    2% replied &quot;Other&quot; and 2% &quot;Don't know&quot; in the Williams Institute survey of 
    american sexual identity).<br><br>If you look at censuses where 
    #$%^-*!@#$ity was much more accepted, the numbers went as high as 4% - not 
    counting bi-sexuals and transgender.<br><br>Aditionally each survey has 
    proven to having a higher amount of people identifying as gay the longer 
    into the 2000 we get. Not surprising the number rise as high as 3% average 
    in 2011-2014<br><br>All of these numbers are of course not including the 
    amount of people who identify as bi-sexual, whom were also a part of 
    Kinseys original number of 10%. Once you do that. Numbers vary from 
    between 9-15% in various countries.<br><br>This has led to believe that 
    while Kinseys numbers might have been high to begin with, there is no 
    final conclusion that they aren't correct either. The major issue here is 
    that these kinds of demographic surveys are hard to make because the rely 
    on the honesty of the participant on a very personal subject. The human 
    mind is complicated, and that is very hard to use in an conclusive argument<br><br>Which 
    leads me to my final point:<br><br>So while 1% is a convenient low number 
    to pull for the sake of argument, it is not entirely correct. Also it 
    still does not give any legitimacy to the arguement that because the 
    people who play a game is low, there shouldn't be some kind of inclusion. 
    First of all you have no idea if your perceived number is true when it 
    comes to the WoW demographic, and secondly out of a player base of 10 
    million players, we are talking 100,000 of the subscriber base which is 
    pretty much a substantial amount of people (if we use your number).<br><br>Also 
    you are making the assumption that all straight people won't see the 
    inclusion of gay characters in the game. This is <strong>far</strong> from 
    the truth and from your argument you make it sound like only 1% of the 
    player base wants this. If you read this thread you would see that some 
    people who I presume are straight argue more for gay representation than 
    those who identify as gay.<br><br><strong>In conclusion</strong> - while 
    your number hold some merit it is not enough to use as an statistical 
    argument against gay characters in WoW. Simply due to the fact that the 
    numbers aren't accurate and that the number might not even apply to the 
    WoW demographic.<br><br>And the part about %^-*-phobes.<br><br>You are in 
    no position to tell people what should or should not matter to them. 
    Secondly if you are not gay, you are in no position to tell gay people how 
    they should or should not feel about a subject. Because something does not 
    matter to <strong>you</strong>, doesn't make it less of a subject for the 
    people interested in it.<br><br>No if it TRULY didn't matter you wouldn't 
    be here arguing against better representation. If it TRULY didn't matter, 
    you wouldn't mind it at all.<br><br>No you are here, because you felt the 
    need to tell other people about YOUR perceived truths on THEIR problems. 
    For some reason beyond me you need to defend WoW's current approach to it, 
    with nothing else than &quot;This isn't a problem&quot; and incorrect numbers to 
    back it up.<br><br>If it doesn't matter. Move along sir, or admit to the 
    fact that you just don't want to see gay characters in the game, for some 
    obscure reason I'll let you keep to yourself.<br><br>I'll even let you 
    admit to the fact that you just don't like to see gay characters. In which 
    I can at least respect your honesty, and just accept that you're a douche 
    towards gay people.

      sake of argument, it is not entirely correct. Also it still does not 
      give any legitimacy to the arguement that because the people who play a 
      game is low, there shouldn't be some kind of inclusion. First of all you 
      have no idea if your perceived number is true when it comes to the WoW 
      demographic, and secondly out of a player base of 10 million players, we 
      are talking 100,000 of the subscriber base which is pretty much a 
      substantial amount of people (if we use your number).<br><br>Also you 
      are making the assumption that all straight people won't see the 
      inclusion of gay characters in the game. This is <strong>far</strong> 
      from the truth and from your argument you make it sound like only 1% of 
      the player base wants this. If you read this thread you would see that 
      some people who I presume are straight argue more for gay representation 
      than those who identify as gay.<br><br><strong>In conclusion</strong> - 
      while your number hold some merit it is not enough to use as an 
      statistical argument against gay characters in WoW. Simply due to the 
      fact that the numbers aren't accurate and that the number might not even 
      apply to the WoW demographic.<br><br>And the part about %^-*-phobes.<br><br>You 
      are in no position to tell people what should or should not matter to 
      them. Secondly if you are not gay, you are in no position to tell gay 
      people how they should or should not feel about a subject. Because 
      something does not matter to <strong>you</strong>, doesn't make it less 
      of a subject for the people interested in it.<br><br>No if it TRULY 
      didn't matter you wouldn't be here arguing against better 
      representation. If it TRULY didn't matter, you wouldn't mind it at all.<br><br>No 
      you are here, because you felt the need to tell other people about YOUR 
      perceived truths on THEIR problems. For some reason beyond me you need 
      to defend WoW's current approach to it, with nothing else than &quot;This 
      isn't a problem&quot; and incorrect numbers to back it up.<br><br>If it 
      doesn't matter. Move along sir, or admit to the fact that you just don't 
      want to see gay characters in the game, for some obscure reason I'll let 
      you keep to yourself.<br><br>I'll even let you admit to the fact that 
      you just don't like to see gay characters. In which I can at least

<br />In a land called Utopia it might be so, but here on Earth some people are eager to judge their neighbours based solely on that: who they decide to sleep or live with. 
<br />It doesn&acute;t matter if you are a lovely person. 
<br />It doesn&acute;t matter if you don&acute;t critice their lives just as they do with yours. 
<br />It doesn&acute;t matter if you fight for their rights as much as yours. 
<br />If you love someone from the same sex as you you should burn in hell and they are perfectly entitled to insult you in public, since you are the sole reason their family values are downgrading to stone age levels. 
<br /> 
<br />Now, while I agree adding a gay character just for the sake of it is unnecesary I wouldn&acute;t oppose it either if it happened. It would help youngsters seeing it as a normal thing. 
<br />Yes, I said youngsters because I think grown up people are too far gone to change their minds if they still live in the middle ages. And because they are the demographic group that more seriously need it. From the people that have insulted me in the street none of them were above 20.","2014-11-27 11:07:00"

<br />In case you didn't know - methodical approach and awareness of potential error in the empirical process is key as to how you interpret your actual results. Social sciences do not have definitive answers. They can tell what they did, and what numbers they got, and each result should be handled with that awareness. If you blindly follow these kinds of results without knowing

 </div>Seriously, gays are ALREADY IN THE GAME, as numerous posters have shown. Why are you still complaining? 
 <br /> 
 <br />There are more DISABLED people playing WoW than there are gays, yet you dont hear them calling for WOW characters in wheelchairs do you.... 
</blockquote> 
<br /> 
<br />People are saying Blizzard could do a better job. Nothing else. Some would call it feedback. You call it complaining. A matter of point of view. Not a definitive truth. 
<br /> 
<br />And yes. Lets bring disabled people into it. You know what? I bet most disabled people are mature enough and kind enough people to know that their 
<em>physical</em> disabilities aren't exactly something that needs to be everywhere. 
<br /> 
<br />On the other hand - and this might be new to you - nothing is wrong with you when you are gay. You are a perfectly normal human being whos natural sexuality makes you act out consenting sex with adults of the same sex. Yet people !@#$ing go around comparing gays to people with actual handicaps that should be taken serious, instead of degrading disabled people and gays by putting them in the same category, 
<strong>when the two groups clearly are different and have different needs.</strong> 
<br /> 
<br />Now that you mention it several games actually have handicapped people in them - even WoW. An entire clan of Orcs mutilate themselves ritually gouging out their own eye. I don't see people going all crazy and accusing handicapped people for causing &quot;a disabled issue&quot;. One of the protagonists in GW2 is an Asura with a leg disease, so she made a Golem she can fight with. A fighting wheelchair. 
<br /> 
<br />She is a loveable character, and no one complained. Because doing so would make you a %^-*ing douche. It is called inclusion. It is called acceptance and respect of diversity among people.

 </div>I have nothing against gay people, people can live their lives how they want to. What I have a problem with is people trying to make everything into a gay issue, wow should do this to include gays etc. No, wow is a game, there's no need to stuff it with gay people just to make some people feel better. 
 <br /> 
 <br />WOW doesn't have any Christians, Muslims, Oriental, Asian people either, and the list goes on and on and on.....should they all be shoe-horned into the game just so its 'diverse' 
</blockquote> 
<br /> 
<br />You know, I can sound like a real a-hole sometimes because I have heard so much bull when it comes the matter of talking about gay and lesbian sexuality. People make so many assumptions and treat their own little perspective as a definitive truth. 
<br /> 
<br />As a gay man or lesbian woman you don't have that luxury. You need to justify your natural behaviour again and again, because you are a minority in that regard. The easiest and most abused argument in the history of man is: &quot; 
<strong>The majority believes...</strong>&quot;. The majority isn't always right, and the majority are in fact not the only human beings on this planet. In fact you could count most gay and lesbian people amongst the majority because they share values and beliefs with people of other sexual orientations aswell. They are perfectly normal tax-paying citizens aswell. 
<br /> 
<br />And that is the ENTIRE point. It is not just making something a &quot;gay issue&quot;. It is a matter of belonging and being accepted within the communites and media we traverse in. 
<br /> 
<br />Identification is the 
<strong>STRONGEST</strong> human emotion to make us relate to something, and when straight relationships are being poured all over the place the media we consume - even hyper sexualized as well - then it is perfectly normal for human beings to want to be included in that portrayal. Humans are social creatures. Being gay doesn't make you lose that craving. 
<br /> 
<br />You say Christianity, Muslims, Orientals etc. are not in WoW. 
<br /> 
<br />I think you need to read up on your WoW lore, because so many religions in WoW are heavily if not directly inspired from the world religions. Pandaren use heavy amounts of Buddhism and Confucianism. The Light is a DIRECT parody of Christianity. Stormwind has Cathedrals for gods sake. The Naaru and the Draenei bear resemblance to Islamic faith and even Wicca, Native American and Voodoo beliefs has made its way into WoW in the Tauren, Night Elf and Troll races. Druids were a religious historical celtic sect. 
<br /> 
<br />Fiction borrows inspiration from the real life world. And WoW is NO different. No one can know everything about the world they borrow inspiration from, and in that part it is perfectly normal and okay, to let game developers know that they just can't pick out essential parts of certain cultures and the leave out essential parts or human beings of that culture. 
<br /> 
<br />Look I am sure you are a nice guy, and I don't mean to demean you in any way. I just want you to understand that this isn't a &quot;gay issue&quot;. It is a human issue that we all should take serious and treat with respect when brought up. Not just write is of as mere complaints.","2014-11-27 15:04:00"

    If you're referring to Kanji, he's not actually gay. If you follow the 
    information the game actually gives about him, he's either Straight or 
    Bisexual. Regardless, he's really not written all that well, and is only 
    given the acclaim he has because of the severe lack of gay representation 
    anywhere else.<br><br>Just had to pick you up about these two particular 
    examples, many of your other ones though are solid. It's a refreshing 
    change to see more and more games actually including LGBT characters, but 
    there's still a -long- way to go, most of the time gay characters are 
    still used as comic relief, stereotypes are still often used, and often 
    developers go so far out of their way to not 'shove it in your face', that 
    it's never even confirmed what their sexuality even is, making the 
    inclusion of that character for representation purposes pointless.

<br />While I think it's fine to include in-game NPC characters that poke fun at stereotypes (of many different kinds), the fact that Blizzard has not, upto this moment at least, normalised gay sexuality in any serious way is one of the main positives that makes them stand out from other large gaming corporations (EA et al).

Sorry everyone but breasts do not make a woman and muscles do not make a goblin male!

11817,353,"c826996b8aa730e4","I would say that as much as I am for the inclusion of !@#$%^-*!@ characters even if only in a subtle way (as in, the same subtle way that #$%^-*!@#$%^ character relationships are mentioned), surely it would also depend on the lore concerning the various cultures within WoW. 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>Tauren?</strong> Given the culture they are based on, it would not be unlikely to see a two-spirit individual, with a male or female wife depending on the bodied/spiritual gender of the Tauren in question. A druid would seem to fit the role of that more than a shaman, in my opinion at least. 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>Orcs?</strong> Most fantasy settings tend to portray them as extremely misogynistic, with the females being trophies at best and chattel at worst. WoW tends to show them rather more equally - females fighting alongside the males being the best example. So that's an 'on the fencer'. 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>Undead?</strong> Um... yeah, no. Certainly not physically anyway, but it would be oddly sweet if there was implied to be some manner of relationship after death between two characters, regardless of the sexuality presented. Certainly that would take it beyond the 'til death do us part' vow, yes? 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>Blood Elf?</strong> As with what I was going to write with the night elves, blood elf society is what I would consider 'high'. They are not primitive by any means, and are magically advanced with flourishing cities. Therefore they would be one of the races that I would assume would be more open to the idea of -*!@#$%^-*ity being acceptable. 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>Pandaren?</strong> Eastern culture in general has had !@#$%^-*!@ marriages in the past, often between older and younger women. Not so much between men however. Pandaren are also what I would consider more spiritually open and 'neutral', thus I cannot see them having an issue with it from what I have seen and read of how the culture is presented. 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>Troll?</strong> See Orc. 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>Goblin?</strong> I would probably say on the fence again. They seem to fall heavily on the technologically advanced side of things, but I have rarely seen any form of culture in the strictest sense as is shown with say, humans and blood elves. So, neutral. 
<br /> 
<br />Onto the Alliance! 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>Night Elves?</strong> See Blood Elves. They are what I think of as 'high' society, so, I would not think that there would be any strong reason for them to reject love between two members of the same sex. 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>Human?</strong> Well we all know how human attitudes defer regarding this subject, don't we? ;) So naturally, I would imagine that such an attitude would carry over into the human culture as presented in WoW. Some would hate it with a passion, some would hide it, some would be proud of it all depending on their geographical location, closest cultural influences and so forth. 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>Gnomes?</strong> See Goblins. 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>Dwarves?</strong> Given the heavily Norse cultural references, I would assume therefore that Dwarven culture reflects the fact that at least male #$%^-*!@#$ity would make the male 'weak'. But then again, Earth Norse culture also implies that that magic users are weak, so. But there is little to no mention of them frowning so heavily on female %^-*!@#$%^ity. 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>Draenei?</strong> They are literally alien, so to expect them to have anything close to the human perspective of sexuality and romantic relationships is laughable. 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<strong>Worgen?</strong> They were once human, so, going with what I wrote for the humans here. 
<br /> 
<br />This is all, of course, just my personal ramblings on the subject based on how I perceive the cultures in-game :)","2014-11-28 01:35:00"

        Persona - one of the best written gay characters is in this series. 
        There isn't any sex. Only a character struggling to come to terms with 
        his own sexuality.

      If you're referring to Kanji, he's not actually gay. If you follow the 
      information the game actually gives about him, he's either Straight or 
      Bisexual. Regardless, he's really not written all that well, and is only 
      given the acclaim he has because of the severe lack of gay 
      representation anywhere else.<br><br>Just had to pick you up about these 
      two particular examples, many of your other ones though are solid. It's 
      a refreshing change to see more and more games actually including LGBT 
      characters, but there's still a -long- way to go, most of the time gay 
      characters are still used as comic relief, stereotypes are still often 
      used, and often developers go so far out of their way to not 'shove it 
      in your face', that it's never even confirmed what their sexuality even 
      is, making the inclusion of that character for representation purposes 
      pointless.
    </blockquote>

    <br>
    Which is actually the perfect representation of how things should be.<br>Integration 
    means that something that is part of a minority is looked upon with the 
    same eyes as everything else.<br>YOU are contributing to separation if you 
    want every character to flash their sexuality for there mere purpose of 
    satisfying a childish whim.<br>I don't want an ingame representation of an 
    epic character with a red shirt because I like them more than blue or 
    white shirts. You know why? Because it's f*cking common sense.

<br />There is nothing wrong with that, but it's the sexuality part. For example, have sex ever benefited anyone in this game? Is there any stories where someone used sex to manipulate someone else. No? Then how would you write a story where gay is important to the character. 
<br />Are you going to have other, homophobic characters, that are against this gay character? Are you going to just team two guys together and have them tag team across azeroth? Because then what makes those more than just &quot;buddies&quot; - Why is it important that one or both of them is gay?

    Sorry to quote you specifically when lots of people have said this, your 
    post was the more handy.<br>Sorry to say but Warcraft already has tons and 
    tons of influence from the real life, like the pandaren culture, Garrosh&#180;s 
    actions mirroring those of a certain german, thousands of pop culture 
    references (some even part of the official lore), alien races acting 
    according to Earth values, Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor vaguely 
    resembling Earth, the tauren culture, etc.<br>That aside, adding a gay 
    character doesn&#180;t automatically mean: &quot;Oh my gosh! They are making out in 
    public! Now the age limit will have to be raised to 18+!&quot;. A questgiver 
    could tell you to find or avenge his husband and that would be all. Why 
    not add a gay couple as long as they behave just like any other couple 
    already in game? It&#180;s the same thing!

    questlines in wow.<br><strong>&quot;how does the story/lore handles gays&quot;</strong> 
    - doesnt HAVE to be a major plot line, it just needs to be there.....like 
    ive already said - quest in stormwind where a lady asks you to take her 
    sons sewing kit to his fathers shop for him.....why couldnt that have been 
    a male questgiver? - does that hugely change the story? nope....neither

    no, its not....not anymore, thats the whole point....<br>i know you dont

    its not a personal attack against you.....but im trying to make you 
    understand that on a global scale, the odd few places that are absolutely 
    anti gay can be catered for.....with very very little impact to the 
    business as a whole, hence me saying its not a valid reason.<br>i fully 
    accept that business is business....without a doubt i agree with 
    you.....but my argument to that IS make a separate client.<br>all the 
    processing is done client side....its the users responsibility....the eula 
    can reflect that youve chosen THAT version so its up to you to take 
    responsibility for it in your country of origin.<br><br>simply put, you 
    have two versions of the client....pretty much the same as each other, in 
    one you can have the game as is now....if you choose a more &quot;enlightened&quot; 
    version, you get gay npcs.<br>mechanics are the same, everything is the 
    same except for the fact that the quest giver is wearing a male skin, not 
    a female, the text says husband, not wife - for example.<br><br>its not 
    about having extra npcs in the game that wander around with gay pride 
    banners, &quot;promoting&quot; hom0sexuality, its all about having simple 
    representation and being included, not excluded......<br><br>at most, its

<br /> 
<br />Do you think of it as an insult?

<br /> 
<br />Doesn't it strike you as a bit weird, when you stop and think about it?

      to the business as a whole, hence me saying its not a valid reason.<br>i 
      fully accept that business is business....without a doubt i agree with 
      you.....but my argument to that IS make a separate client.<br>all the 
      processing is done client side....its the users responsibility....the 
      eula can reflect that youve chosen THAT version so its up to you to take 
      responsibility for it in your country of origin.<br><br>simply put, you 
      have two versions of the client....pretty much the same as each other, 
      in one you can have the game as is now....if you choose a more 
      &quot;enlightened&quot; version, you get gay npcs.<br>mechanics are the 
      same, everything is the same except for the fact that the quest giver is 
      wearing a male skin, not a female, the text says husband, not wife - for 
      example.<br><br>its not about having extra npcs in the game that wander 
      around with gay pride banners, &quot;promoting&quot; hom0sexuality, its all about 
      having simple representation and being included, not excluded......<br><br>at

<br />Nothing in coding is &quot;a couple of hours work&quot;. 
<br /> 
<br />A change in one line affects lines in the code not even related to that, thus why so many bugs appear in large scale games. 
<br /> 
<br />Coding an entirely new client is a massive undertaking, it would need to yield massive profit for any company to be willing to do it. 
<br /> 
<br />You can argue until your blue in the face but it's all about the money and the money they would make for doing what you propose wouldn't be worth their time.

<br />Wow is not mandatory, and it is not prescribe. It also makes no statement on sexuality, or sexual preference. The bigotry card is therefore a non-sequitur.

  <br />You're totally wrong. We're not putting it in the game so children can learn about it. People are gay, they don't learn to be gay. The reason people want to see gay people represented in WOW is because they believe that minorities should be represented in all communities. 
 </blockquote> 
 <br /> 
 <br />Seriously, why should all minorities be represented in 
 <strong>everything</strong>? 
 <br /> 
 <br />It's just a ridiculous request, if there is no specific reason for a minority to be included then they don't need to be. Developers can add them if they feel like it, if they'd rather spend their time on something else then they can. If you don't like it, don't play the game. Or get over it.

<br /> 
<br />When did I say I wanted them to 'flash their sexuality'? Why is it people don't seem to realise that you -can- confirm a character's sexuality without doing it in a showy, needlessly-intrusive way? 
<br /> 
<br />There are -plenty- of examples of straight characters in video games. They don't just randomly say &quot;Oh hey by the way I'm straight wooo!&quot; do they? You just learn it from the simple fact that they happen to have a partner of the opposite sex, or from them having a crush or feelings toward someone of the opposite sex, and no-one ever bats an eyelid at this. However, someone asking to have a character who just happens to have a partner of the -same- sex, or to show any sort of romantic feelings towards someone of the -same- sex, is apparently terrible because then it's 'flashing your sexuality'. 
<br /> 
<br />This mindset, of having a double-standard where it's perfectly fine to have openly straight characters, to the extent that some people even seem to claim there -aren't- 'openly-straight characters' in games, and where asking for gay characters in exactly the same kind of situations, is apparently wrong and terrible, is quite simply homophobic.","2014-11-28 19:02:00"

You just learn it from the simple fact that they happen to have a partner of the opposite sex, or from them having a crush or feelings toward someone of the opposite sex, and no-one ever bats an eyelid at this. However, someone asking to have a character who just happens to have a partner of the -same- sex, or to show any sort of romantic feelings towards someone of the -same- sex, is apparently terrible because then it's 'flashing your sexuality'. 
 <br /> 
 <br />This mindset, of having a double-standard where it's perfectly fine to have openly straight characters, to the extent that some people even seem to claim there -aren't- 'openly-straight characters' in games, and where asking for gay characters in exactly the same kind of situations, is apparently wrong and terrible, is quite simply homophobic.

<br />When you start arguing that the mere mention of sexuality is like &quot;flashing it&quot;, then you are automaticly enforcing cenorship upon a game that already delve into subjects of relationships and love. I've mentioned several cases of character development in WoW where personal love life and relationship is key to a character. You do set a double-standard by doing this, and you pander

<br />I think the bolded bit is a classic trap people fall into when attempting not to stereotype. Avoiding stereotyping someone and essentially making a trait they have irrelevant are two different things. For example, a well written gay character needs to avoid being a stereotype 
<strong>without</strong> ignoring the fact they are gay, or what would be the point? That can be achieved by them being in a same sex relationship, but equally can be accomplished through storyline or character traits that are the result of being gay. A character who has been oppressed due to their sexuality or found adversity in some situation due to not conforming to societal expectations.

    Actually this is not necessarily true. There's been a lot of research on 
    same gender attraction (and action) among animals and it turned out it is 
    actually not that uncommon that males of certain species will be attracted 
    to other males, and females to females. And they won't even bite each 
    others' heads off. I guess humans liking the same gender is pretty natural 
    :).<br><br>So besides your post being very narrowminded, it's blatantly

 <br /> 
 <br />A lot of young people play the game, and it'd make a good impression, and help people be more accepting in everyday life. 
 <br /> 
 <br />Yes, I'm gay, and don't really care about the homophobes, but think WoW would be doing themselves a service if they implemented a character into the game which is gay.

<br />Big Bearded, Muscular dwarves when clicked on say in a gruff voice &quot;Can I interest you in a pint?&quot; Clearly Grizzly Adams Bears

<br />Arthus who turned down Jaina Proudmore... clearly... he has to be...Jaina F&amp;*(^$g Proudmore!

    the direction intended, or at all for that matter. For example, of course. 
    If someone can't do more than 10k dps on Madness of Deathwing, that's a 
    bad player. However, it's not me who said it's a bad thing. You're the one 
    who's implied that. People can get better, you know this right? Ergo by 
    having something like this as a reward from a particularly challenging 
    objective means that there's more incentive to get better. What I mean by 
    what I said is that, other than not really raiding heroic mode content, 
    there's no incentive to get better at the game if the rewards are handed 
    to players despite their ability.<br><br>

<br />How can you claim that when there are so many posts where people go bonkers over &quot;bad&quot; players having this, or it not being extremely rare? 
<br /> 
<br />On another note: 
<br /> 
<br />I can honestly say that I'd rather have every mount be available to everyone so that I could enjoy them all, than have hard-to-get mounts only a few would be lucky to have and thus me not being able to enjoy them...since by the end of the day, I play this game to enjoy MYSELF, not to e-peen in front of others or have other players e-peen in front of me.

<br />I have no problem with store bought items and i've done it several times over several accounts. I've also been asked already &quot;Oh you want to get it, it can be valentines gifts?&quot; since we share finances I wouldn't buy something without asking, I am in no way saying the following because I am crying over not being able to have it. 
<br /> 
<br />I also don't raid so I would never obtain this mount if it were to be raid gotten. Maybe if it was ever 3 mannable in MoP without being a faceroll we would eventually get there, but otherwise, nope. 
<br /> 
<br />I think that since it clearly is an integral part of this expansions lore it should be a really good reward for completling that expansion, I would gain nothing from it it just doesn't do the mount justice.

<br />It's nothing like it really, anyone with half a brain could figure out that Shadowmourne during its relevant time had a lot more influence on the gameplay for those that got it than this drake will ever have.

<br /> 
<br />Edit: Oh sorry, I always mistake the 2 (and especially this late at night)...although then I'll change my standpoint to the one of the poster further down. 
<br /> 
<br />In the end, this is just a vanity item...it'll never matter as much as in-game mounts or other in-game items that you use for gameplay, and it being good looking = just makes those that feel excited about it even happier.

<br />Not at all. The Heart of the Aspects is the essence of the Dragon Soul - you actually see it shoot out of the Dragon Soul to destroy Deathwing in the Dragon Soul raid. It's the very incarnation of the power used to the create the Dragon Soul, that's why it's a &quot;chromatic&quot; dragon.","2012-02-15 00:07:00"
